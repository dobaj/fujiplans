        "Directions": "Before the Lesson\n\nPrepare the addition books for each student.  Reproduce pages 54-55.  Cut the pages so that there is one addition problem per page.  The cover sheet should be on top.  Staple them along the left side with two staples in book form.  Each book should contain four pages.\nMake a pair of mittens for each student or request a pair of mittens or gloves from home labeled with the student's name.  If you are making the mittens with paper, make each pair different.  Vary the colors or designs.  Try using wallpaper samples instead of construction paper for variety.  They are sturdy and can be quite colorful.  \nMake a floor chart, using butcher paper or masking tape.\n\nProcedure\n\nReread the nursery rhyme Three Little Kittens.\nAsk the students if they have ever lost anything.  Ask them to share with the class problem-solving strategies that they used to find the items.\nHave one-half of the class get out their mittens and put them into a pile.  Mix the pile and randomly hand each student from the other half of the class one mitten.  Ask the students to find the persons who have the matching mittens.\nWhen the students have found the mates to their mittens, have them describe to their partners the properties they looked for while trying to find the mates.\nGather the mittens and put them aside.\nRepeat the activity with the other half of the class' mittens.\nReturn the mittens to the original owners when the activity is complete.\nGraph the number of mittens on the floor graph.  Discuss the results (of which are there more, of which are there fewer).\nHave the students sort and pattern the mittens in cooperative groups.\n\nCenter Idea\r\nAs a follow-up activity in a math center, have the students play mitten/kitten addition.  Each student receives two dice, tiny chart stickers, and a copy of My Addition Booklet.  Students will roll the dice and add them together to explore fact strategies.  Students will then record their answers in their activity books.  Each student will have room to record three math problems.",

        "Objective": "Students will learn about writing narrative nonfiction pieces.",
        "Directions": "Nonfiction narrative writing tells a story or an event that is true.  There are two primary categories of narrative writing--personal and biographical.  A personal narrative tells about the experiences of the author.  A biographical narrative tells the story of another person by the author, whether from personal observation or from history.  The structure must be organized to tell a story either in the order it happened or in some other logical sequence.  Many narratives also include messages, morals, or lessons as part of their purpose.\n\r\nOn pages 161 and 162 there are two examples of narrative autobiographical writing.  The first one is called This is Your Lifeline! and the second one is called Star of the Week.  Below are directions for both.\n\r\nTo help you get to know the children better and to help the children get to know one another better, a perfect writing activity for the beginning of the year is the lifeline.  Give each child six index cards along with a copy of page 161.  After completing page 161, the sentences are cut apart and glued to the back of each card.  Each child brings in a photograph for every year of his or her life and glues each to the front of each corresponding card.  (You may have the child draw pictures instead of bringing in photos.)  The cards are attached together with yarn in chronological order (as shown on page 161) and displayed around the room for all to enjoy.  An optional card could be added that includes something the child may want to accomplish during the school year.\n\r\nEach week in many classrooms a child is selected to be Star of the Week.  The child can be chosen by alphabetical order or in a random drawing until everyone has a turn.  To make the paper doll of the star of the week, trace an outline of the child on bulletin-board paper.  Have the child color the outline and display the cutout on the wall along with interview finish-me sentences (see page 162) about different parts of his or her body.  These sentences are completed, put on index cards, and glued or stapled to the doll.  At the end of the week, the star child takes the paper doll home to keep.",

        "Title": "Math Detectives Activity: Alien Invaders!",
        "URL": "https://www.teachercreated.com/lessons/100",
        "Grade Level": "1st - 3rd Grades",
        "Description": "Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.), Problem Solving",
        "Objective": "Students become \"math detectives\" and solve a series of story problems or word problems in order to finish an adventure.  The activity connects math and reading while reinforcing critical thinking and problem-solving skills",
        "Directions": "Introduction\r\nWhat is a Problem-Solving Math Mystery?\r\nChildren love a good adventure story.  It is even more exciting if they are \"living\" and experiencing the story!The adventure is divided into several parts.  Every part has an accompanying math problem that must be solved before the student can move on to the next part of the adventure.  Five answers with five page numbers are given with every problem.  If the student chooses the correct answer, a page number is given that continues the adventure.  If the incorrect answer is chosen, a page number is given that describes a less desirable turn of events, such as being made to do a thousand pushups by an alien fitness instructor.  Then the student must return to the last problem and try again.\n\r\nWork must always be shown to ensure that the child can work and understand the math problem.  (Note:  If students need more work space they can use the blank page that precedes the page to which they must return.)  When the adventure is successfully completed, the student is given an Official Expert Math Detective Badge and promoted to the next detective level. \r\nIt is recommended that the teacher have the students work in teacher-selected groups of four that each contain a strong reader and a strong math student (or a child with good problem-solving skills) for optimum success.  The students should each have their own story book (detective's notebook) and should each be responsible for showing their work.  Remind them that they will have the assistance of other group members to figure out what is being asked and how to solve the problems.  It is also beneficial to assign jobs to each group member such as the following:\n\nReader (This student reads the story parts to the group.)\nRecorder (This student can record notes/ideas for group on scratch paper until the final answer is found.  Then all members record the work in their individual books.)\nTask Master (This student makes sure that everyone is participating and on task.)\nQuestioner (This student is the only one allowed to raise his or her hand for adult help and then only if no one in the group can answer the question.)\n\n How to Use the Book\n\n Assembling the Story\r\nThe book is 24 half-pages long (12 full pages).  Once a book is photocopied, it can easily be cut along the dashed lines, collated, and stapled.  Each book has illustrated pages, and each of the pages is numbered. It is recommended that three staples be used on the left-hand margin because the pages will be turned often since the problems are scattered throughout the book, not in chronological order.  (That would be too easy!)\n\r\nReading the Stories and Solving the Math Mysteries\r\nBefore students begin, model how to use the book by following these steps:\n\nSet the scene for the stories.\n\r\n    Explain that the student is a junior math detective on his or her first case.  The student detective will be embarking on a special adventure.  They will have a detective's notebook (the assembled story book) that tells their story and must be used to show all of their detective's work.  (This is best done on the blank back of the page opposite the problem.)  If they can solve each problem in the story successfully, they move on to the next part of the adventure and ultimately solve the case, get promoted, and get assigned a new mission.  If they cannot solve a problem, something unfortunate will happen to them and they will have to try the problem again!\nModel how to show the work in the detective's notebook (the storybook).\n\r\n    An answer alone is not sufficient.  To demonstrate understanding of the problem and its solution, the student must draw a picture, write an equation, or write a simple sentence such as \"I got the answer by using the clock model in my detectives kit.\"  Remind students that they must show proof that they know how to solve the problem just like real detectives do when they file a report.\nWork the first two or three problems with the students.\n\r\n    If students have not been exposed to many story or word problems before, this becomes a teachable moment.  For a whole class lesson, make an overhead transparency of the problems. \n\r\n    Here are several clues to share with the class.  You may wish to post them in the classroom as reminders for students.\n\r\n    Detective Clues for Solving Math Story Problems\n\nEvery problem should be carefully read two times before trying to solve it.\nLook for words that give you hints on what is to be done such as \"all together\" or \"in all\" which tends to mean you add, and \"got away\" or \"loses\" which tends to imply subtraction, etc.\nUse the detective's kit whenever possible.\nRead all of the answers before choosing one.  At least one or two should obviously be wrong.  There are also a few problems with more than one correct answer or an \"all of the above\" option.\nIf you are really stuck, try working backwards.  Choose an answer that looks reasonable and try to prove it correct.  (Remind the student, however, that a picture, an equation, or a sentence showing how the correct answer was arrived at must accompany all answers.) \nUse a bookmark or self-sticking note to mark the page you are on so that you do not lose your place if you turn to a page that is not the correct answer and you have to go back and work the problem again.  Remove the bookmark only when your work is shown and you have definitely found the correct answer and the next part of the adventure.  Then place the bookmark on this new page and continue as above.\nWhen you have found all the correct answers, highlight them on each correct page.  Then, read the story from beginning to end using only the correct pages.\n\n\r\n    Good luck on your adventure!",

A question is something that is asked and needs an answer.\r\nThe first step to solving a word problem is to read the problem a few times to find out the facts and the question.  Look for words in the problem that may give clues about whether to add, subtract, multiply, or divide.  This will help to find the answer.  Some of the words follow.\r\nAddition: addends, all together, in all, many, more, sum, total\r\nSubtraction: difference, fewer, left, many, more\r\nMultiplication: factor, groups, how many, in all, multiple, product\r\nDivision: group, how many, in all, quotient, remainder, separate\r\nThe second step to solving a word problem is to name the words that give you clues about whether to add, subtract, multiply, or divide to solve the word problem.\r\nGive students the following examples and ask if they know what they would need to do to solve the problem.\r\nDavid has 15 baseball cards.  His brother gave him 15 more baseball cards.  How many in all? \r\nIn the football game, Anthony scored 12 points.  Then he scored 18 more points.  What was the total number of points he scored? \r\nThe third step to solving a word problem is to draw a picture to show the solution, or use real items to solve the problem.  In the following example, you could draw apples or use real ones.\r\nAlyssa picked three baskets of apples.  Each basket had 14 apples.  How many apples were there in all?\r\nThe final step to solving a word problem is to look at the drawing or real-life example, write out the math sentence that it represents, and solve the problem.

        "Directions": "Using Estimation for Math Snacks\r\nEstimation is an important math strategy.  Working with estimation can be an enjoyable addition to the daily math snacks activities.  Children love to guess how many there are of something and then count to see how close they came to the actual number answer.  One way to provide students with practice in estimating is to present them with a small sampling of a snack and have them estimate and count the items they have in front of them.  Another method is to provide one large class snack and take several guesses as to how many there are of the item before counting the entire snack in front of the class.  As you do this you are providing students with models of how to group and of the various strategies used for counting.\r\nYou can also take guesses on a large class snack and divide the counting responsibility among small groups of students.  When each group has finished counting its sample, you can model for the class, showing how you add two-digit and three-digit numbers to find a total.\r\nAnother estimation strategy is to use the serving information on snack packages to model how you, as the teacher, often decide whether a snack will be enough for the class.  It is also a way to show the multiplication of larger numbers in a real-life setting.\r\nYet another estimation strategy requires that you reveal more and more information until the students can accurately determine the total number of items in the container.  This method takes a little more preparation on the teacher's part.  Have students guess a total number based only on the external size of the container.  After the students have recorded their initial guesses, remind them that they cannot change the initial answer, but they can alter the following answers once you tell them more information.  Next, tell the students how many of the item fit inside one cup.  At this point, they can write a new answer down, or they can record the old answer if they feel it is still a reasonable answer.  Finally, tell the students how many cups fill the container.  Now, the students do the majority of their thinking as they know how many cups of items are in the container and how many items are in each cup.  Require that they show their thinking processes on paper and come up with final estimations as to how many items are in the container.  As with all math snacks activities, students should communicate their answers and their thinking.  When all estimation attempts have been made, count the items to find the actual total.",

Cut apart the eye patterns but do not color them. \nObtain small hand-held mirrors for students to use. You may wish to have small groups of students share the mirrors to reduce the number needed. \n\nDirections\n\nBegin this activity by discussing the similarities and differences among people's appearances. Point out what color your eyes are and explain that your eye color might be similar to some students but different from others. \nProvide mirrors for students to determine their eye colors. Have them tell you what color their eyes are. If necessary, help them identify their eye colors. Distribute the eye patterns according to students' eye colors. Ask students to color the patterns the same colors as their eyes. If a student has blue-green or hazel eyes, he or she can choose either blue or green, or you can substitute blue-green or hazel for gray on the eye pattern and graph. \nAs you call each color (brown, blue, green, gray) listed on the table, have students raise their eye patterns if their eyes are that color. Invite the class to help you count the eye patterns to determine how many students have each eye color. Record the data on the overhead or the board. \nUse the floor or wall graph to model the activity. Show students how to mark the scale along the bottom, counting by ones, twos, or threes. Help students place the bars on the graph. \nHave students record the results on their bar graphs. \nDiscuss the questions (page 53) and ask additional ones to check students' understanding. \n\nExtension Activities\n\nExplain that the pupil is the black circle that is in the center of each eye. Point out that the pupil changes size to allow more or less light into the eye. The more light there is, the smaller the pupil gets. The less light there is, the larger the pupil gets. Assign partners or provide a mirror for each student. Turn off the lights for a couple of minutes. Ask students to observe the changes in the pupils. \nCreate pictographs, using the small eye patterns (page 52). \nInvite students to name objects in the classroom that are the same colors as their eyes. \n",

These basics introduce  the necessary skills and knowledge that students will need to create effective  book reports. Students can use this knowledge to complete the Accordion-Book  Summary activity.\nBook Report Basics\nWriting Skills\nThe basic steps in the writing process include the following: \nPrewriting\nIn this step you brainstorm, think about your topic, create webs and  clusters, outline, research, and play around with ideas and words.\nFirst Draft Writing\nThis is when you simply write all your ideas. Don't worry about anything  except saying what you want to say.\nRevision\nAfter you write your rough draft, go back over what you wrote. Correct  spelling and grammar, look up any words you need to, take some things out and  add others, and arrange your paragraphs.\nEvaluation\nShare your work with someone. This person could be your teacher, a friend or  parent, a classmate, or others in a writers' workshop. Collect valuable  information about what works and what doesn't work in your report.\nEditing and Rewriting\nNow that you have some fresh ideas, go over your work again. Correct any  spelling or grammatical errors you might have missed before; add any ideas you  got from others that you liked. Make a final copy of your writing.\nPublishing\nWhen others are able to read your finished product, you have published. Your  work may appear on a bulletin board, in a class book, in your own book, in a  portfolio, or in a newsletter.\nEvaluation\nIn this stage, your teacher or your classmates will let you know what they  think of your report. Your teacher will evaluate your report to make sure you  completed it according to the directions given to you.\nBasic Book Report Writing Essentials\nFor a Fiction Book\nInclude the title and author's name. Don't forget your own name as the author  of the book report. \nCompose a theme statement. This will really impress your teacher. The theme  is the main idea of the story. To help you figure out what the theme is in your  book, ask yourself these questions:\nWhat does the main character learn by the end of the book? What is the  author's purpose in writing the book? Or, if someone asked you to quickly say  what the book is about, what would you say?\nSummarize the story. This is writing about the plot. The summary is different  from the theme because in the summary you tell what happens in the story,  especially what happens to the main character. Be sure you have a beginning, a  middle, and an ending in your summary, just as you would in a story.\nGive your opinion. End your book report by saying whether or not you liked  the book and whether or not you would recommend it to your friends to read. \nFor a Nonfiction Book\nInclude the title, author's name, and your name.\nCompose a theme statement. For a nonfiction book it might be, The author  wanted to show that spiders are fascinating and are not to be feared.\nSummarize. Cover the topics as listed in the table of contents. Give a few  details for each, perhaps interesting things you learned.\nState your opinion. In addition to stating whether or not you liked the book,  think about the following: Did the author provide the information you expected  to find? Was the writing interesting and easy to understand? Did you learn  anything new?\nDistribute the activity sheet and materials to students.",

        "Objective": "Students learn about verbs.",
        "Directions": "Introduction\r\nThrough informal activities and class discussion, first and second grade students should come to understand that a verb is a word that expresses an action. Children at this age might find it more accessible to use everyday terminology, such as doing words or action words.\n\r\nChildren need to develop an awareness of the following types of verbs and their uses.\r\n(a) Doing verbs are words that express a concrete action. They are common in spoken language and in the writing of young children. \n Examples:  work, run, sit, eat, jump\n\n (b) Saying verbs express a spoken action.\n Examples:  talk, tell, said, suggested, yelled\n\n (c) Some verbs do not express a concrete action--they express actions that happen mentally, such as feelings, ideas, thoughts, or attitudes. These can be called thinking and feeling verbs. They are common in arguments, narratives, and descriptions (but not scientific descriptions, which are objective).\r\nExamples: I like Sam.  I understand.  Katy believed the story.  \n                    I see the rabbit.  I think people should recycle.\n\n (d) Some verbs tell us about what things are and what they have. These are being and having verbs. They are common in all kinds of descriptions. \nExamples: Ben is a good swimmer. Ali has the answer. They are here.\r\n(Is, are, has, and have can also act as auxiliary or helping verbs for doing, thinking, and feeling verbs. Example: Ben is swimming.)\r\nA verb is the key around which a sentence is built, and children need to be shown the importance of choosing the most expressive verb when speaking or writing. \r\nAt this level, children should also be given constant informal practice in the correct use of certain verbs which are often misused.\n\n Examples:\r\nwent--gone\r\nmay--can\r\nseen--saw\r\nswim--swam\r\ndid--done\r\nbroke--broken\r\ncame--come\r\nlearn--teach\r\nwas--were\r\nsing--sung\n\n Teaching Strategies \r\nGet active\r\nCall for volunteers to perform certain actions and then describe what they are doing. Write what they say on the chalkboard and have other children underline the word(s) that expresses the action. I am jumping on the spot. I am hitting the door.\n\n Mime time\r\nHave selected children mime certain actions and challenge the rest of the class to guess what they are doing. Write the guesses on the chalkboard and have children underline the words that express the actions. Are you sweeping the floor? Are you milking a cow?\n\n Verb list \r\nProvide children with a suitable noun and then have them add a number of verbs saying what that noun does. A snake bites and hisses. A horse gallops and neighs.\n\n Vague verbs \r\nHave students suggest more descriptive synonyms for certain verbs such as walk. Make lists to post in the classroom so students can refer to them while they are studying verbs and composing sentences.\n\n\n\nwalk\nrun\nsay\n\n\nstroll\ntrot\nexclaim\n\n\nlimp\nrace\nwhisper\n\n\nshuffle\nlope\nsnarl\n\n\n\n\n Correct it \r\nTell children a sentence with an incorrect use of a verb. Have them orally correct it.\r\nThe boys have went.The boys have gone. Can I get a drink, please?May I get a drink, please?\n\n Verb match\r\nCreate two sets of labels--one set with names written on them, the other with matching verbs. Attach the labels to the chalkboard and have children sort them into matching pairs.\n\n\n\ndogs\nbark\n\n\ncats\npurr\n\n\nelephants\ntrumpet\n\n\nfrogs\ncroak\n\n\n\n\n Picture search \r\nHave children search through old magazines and newspapers to find pictures in which an action is taking place. Then have them paste the chosen pictures on a large sheet of paper and beside each picture write a sentence describing the action. The lady is driving the car. The man is hitting the golf ball.\n\r\nI can \r\nAsk children to demonstrate what they can do, describing it aloud as they do it.\r\nI can hop.\r\nI can jump.\r\nI can read.\n\r\nDistribute the Verbs activity sheets to students and have them use what they have learned to complete them.",

Students locate information about local, state, and national communities using a variety of traditional sources, electronic technologies, and direct observations.",
        "Directions": "Description\r\nIn this lesson, the students will gain and apply knowledge of life in their own community and compare specific aspects of it to life in other communities.  They will work in small groups to fill out a questionnaire about life in their community, and email it to e-pals in other communities.  They will take digital pictures of important places in their town, and request their e-pals do the same if possible.  The culminating activity will be an oral group presentation of the information received from their e-pals, and a comparison of this information to the information they gathered about their own town.\r\nAs part of a social studies curriculum, the students study their community and how the community helps us to meet our basic needs.  The class also gathers information about other communities around the country to see how they compare with ours in terms of how basic needs are met.  Print materials, such as textbooks, are outdated so quickly, and this method of getting information is guaranteed to stay current year after year.   Also, the information in textbooks is presented from an adult's point of view.  Communicating with peers gives them information from a child's point of view, and really engages the students.  It encourages them to explore the connections and relationships between their town and the one the e-pals live in, and also the connection between them and their own community.  Along with enjoying the study of the community, the addition of the peer communication via the Internet adds an extra dimension that really generates excitement and meaningful conversations.\nPreparation\r\nReview basic map reading.  If possible, go on a field trip around town, and work with parents and other adults in the community to find the answers to the questions on the All About Our Community questionnaire sheet.  Students will then email the questionnaire to their selected e-pals to answer and return.  On the town field trip , children can take digital photos of important places, and include them in the mailing to their e-pals.  They can post them on the class web site, along with a narrative of each important place.  This helps to foster feelings of connection to the project and the community.  When the questionnaire is returned, the group of students who received it prepare a presentation for the class.  When they are preparing the presentation, they will use the scoring rubric to guide them in their preparation.   While students work on the presentation, encourage them to engage in conversations with their group about the information they have received, and the things they have learned about their own town.  These conversations will help to build an improved and shared understanding of the topic.  They will make connections between the things they have learned and how it affects their lives.\r\nSet up e-pals for the students.  Below are some suggested websites for connecting your students with students around the country.\nStep-by-Step Teacher and Student Instructions\r\nThe first lessons should focus on the history of your community.  Use any materials you have available to you including any special guests you can invite to share their knowledge with you.  After the completion of the history piece of your community, introduce the concept of basic needs, and discuss how people in your town used to meet their needs, and how their needs are being met in the present day.\r\nTake the field trip through the community to see important places.  Take digital pictures.\r\nThe students now should be prepared to start filling in the questionnaire about the community they live in.  This should be done with their small group, and some brainstorming of possible sources of information should be done with the whole group.  The students might need to take the sheet home to consult with parents or other family members.  Groups will be heterogeneous and teacher selected, consisting of 4-5 students.\r\nThe students should make initial contact with the group of e-pals they have selected (or the teacher has selected for them).  They should send a copy of their completed sheet about their own community and a blank sheet to be filled out by the group of students in another town.\r\nWhile they are waiting for the reply, the group should find the community on the map.  They should also get started on the visual aid for the presentation.  This will require a little research by the group.  The visual aid will be a poster showing the city/town placement within the state, and include the information that the students gather.  Suggested information for the poster, along with the map: highlights of the town, nickname/logo, pictures of things that are grown and or manufactured there, interesting historical facts, fun things for kids to do, population.  If the e-pals send photos of their town, these will be included in the visual aid also.\r\nWhen the group receives the reply, they will need to meet and prepare the oral presentation, and add any new information to the visual aid.\r\nEach student in the group will fill out the rubric to be sure they have met all the requirements, then present the oral report to the class.\nAssessment/Evaluation\r\nFill out the rubric for each of the group members as they do their oral presentations.  They will also be evaluated on the accuracy of the information included in the questionnaire they fill out regarding their community.  The students will be encouraged to discuss the differences between the two communities and give some reasons why they think there are differences.  Both large and small group discussions to reflect on the differences will be facilitated as the information is received from the e-pals.  Take anecdotal notes as groups work together.  \nExtensions\r\nThe students could continue to communicate with their e-pals to discuss other aspects of life in their community.  The community questionnaire along with the digital pictures taken from the field trip could be attached to the class web page.  More information could be included with the pictures.  The community study/comparison could be extended to include towns outside of the United States.  Parents could be asked to supply the email addresses of family members in other states instead of using the suggested web sites.",

The oldest works of art are rock painting and engraving that dates to 6000 B.C.  African art reflects the cultural diversity of the continent's ethnic groups and gives expression to the rich histories, philosophies, religions, and societies of the people.  Among the traditional types of African art are sculpture, furniture, pottery, textiles, and jewelry. \r\nEach individual ethnic group has its own traditions regarding both the subject and form of representation.  Some cultures value naturalistic representations while others favor abstraction.  Materials used in art are determined by their availability in each region and include wood, fiber, metal, ivory, clay, earth, and stone.\r\nThe African people often use masks as part of their celebrations.  The masks are made from a variety of materials and range from simple designs to ornate wood carvings.  The subject may be an animal or a mythical being.  Many people in other countries collect these masks as works of art.\r\nMasks are a very important part of African culture.  Each mask has its own purpose.  Some are worn as ornaments while others are used in religious ceremonies.  Dancers wear them to communicate with spirits.  The spirits express themselves through the masks.  African masks are made of many different kinds of materials.  They are decorated with simple, strong, and powerful shapes and designs.  Doctors wear the masks to concentrate the healing powers of nature.\r\nBefore students begin creating their masks, reproduce the Make an African Mask patterns onto white construction paper.\r\nHave students cut out the top and bottom patterns of the mask.  They should cut the slits for the forehead, chin, and cheeks.\r\nHave students overlap the sides of each slit and staple or glue them back together to create a three-dimensional effect. \r\nStudents can then cut out geometric shapes to create the facial features and other designs for the mask.  The eyes, nose, and mouth should be exaggerated to show their importance.\r\nIf desired, use raffia fibers or shredded cornhusks for hair.",

Then, have them complete pages 84 and 85.\r\nBeautiful butterflies, colorful birds, mischievous monkeys, and deadly snakes live on the varied landscapes of Mexico.  The jaguar was a symbol of power to the Aztecs, and the colorful birds gave their feathers for the traditional costumes.\r\nOne of the great, mysterious attractions in Mexico is the migration of millions of Monarch butterflies to the eastern part of Michoacan.  No one understands why the butterflies make this journey each year, but it is a beautiful sight as millions of orange and black wings flutter through the air.\r\nIguanas and Gila monsters are two of the lizards that live in the desert areas of Mexico.  You can often see children selling iguanas by the roadsides in the country, but stay away from the Gila monsters because they are poisonous.  Other desert animals include coyotes, lizards, prairie dogs, and rattlesnakes.\r\nSpider monkeys and parrots like to live in the tropical forests where there is an abundance of trees.  The spider monkey winds its way through the branches like a professional acrobat, and can sometimes be a pest if you are eating food nearby.  The parrots have brightly colored feathers that make them easy to see in the green foliage.  Macaws also live in the tropical forests.  The quetzal bird has long, brightly colored feathers that the Aztecs used for their ceremonial costumes.  Unfortunately, the quetzal is becoming very rare.\r\nOne peculiar animal that lives in the jungle areas is the peccary.  This funny-looking animal is a type of wild hog, and is called a javelina in Spanish.  Ringtail cats also enjoy the jungle areas for hunting.  Other cats that live in the Mexican jungles are ocelots, jaguars, and margays.\r\nThe dolphin and starfish can be found in the ocean areas of Mexico.  Dolphins like to play off the shore, diving and swimming in the clear waters of the Pacific.  Gray whales are sometimes also sighted off the shores of Baja California.  Many other sea fish live near the Mexican shores and make fishing a big industry for the country.\r\nThe interesting and varied animal life of Mexico is as fragile as life anywhere.  Much of the wildlife is disappearing as the land is developed for logging, farming, and industry.  A blight along the coast of the Caribbean has claimed many of the palm trees, which are a natural habitat for the parrots and macaws.  Logging is changing the migration patterns of the butterflies.  Ecology is very delicate, and we must all work to protect our planet and the animals that live here.\r\nDistribute the Amazing Animals of Mexico activity sheets and have students complete the activity.  If time permits, have them color the pages after they have finished gluing the pictures of the animals.",

        "Directions": "This lesson can take place over a week to coincide with a safety week or Fire Prevention Week or can be taught as a separate social studies unit.  Begin by discussing some general fire facts with students.  This is designed to be an oral exercise to establish a general base of information.  See what the students do not know and give them the information that they do not have.  Expand on and discuss the different ideas for reinforcement.\r\nControlled fire is one of humanity's best friends.  Primitive people used fire for heating, cooking, turning clay into pottery, and light.  Except for furnishing light, fire is used by people today for much the same things.  Fire also furnishes the energy for running steam engines and other machines.  It is used to separate metals from their ores and for many chemical processes.\r\nUncontrolled fire is one of humanity's worst enemies.  Fires have caused many deaths and billions of dollars in property damage in the United States.  Some fires are brought about by natural causes.  Lightning often starts forest fires.  Some fires are caused by carelessness, and others are set on purpose.\n\nSafety Walk\r\nDistribute a copy of your school map to each student.  Take a walk around your school and note the position of fire alarm boxes, fire extinguishers, and fire hydrants.  Have students mark all these on their maps.\r\nWhen you get back to the classroom, pool all of your information and make one good copy of the map.  Run off enough copies to give to the school office and for each classroom in the school to post for their information and safety.\r\nGive some consideration to discussing the serious offense of giving a false alarm.  Most schools have very severe penalties for this kind of misbehavior, and students should be warned ahead of time of the consequences of pulling such a prank.\n\nSafety Plan\nHave students draw a sketch of the floor plan of their homes, indicating doors and windows and second stories if they have them.  If they live in apartments or condominiums, have them show stairways and attached buildings.\r\nSend these sketches home with students so they can discuss them with their parents and make family plans for escaping from a fire.\n\nSafety Posters\r\nHave students create fire prevention posters.  Remind them to think of good slogans and use simple, bright pictures and big letters.  Put the posters up around the school.\r\nFire Fighting Equipment\r\nDistribute a copy of the Fire Fighting Equipment activity page to each student.  Have them do research to find out about each kind of engine.  Then they can color the engines.  If time permits, have them draw lines and labels to identify the different equipment on the fire engines.",

On one side of each index card, draw the necessary dots to represent each letter.  Then write the actual alphabet letter on the back of each card.  Place the set of cards in a learning center for children to use during free or planned center time.\nWho Is It?\r\nWrite each child's name on an index card in Braille.  Place the index cards in a basket.  Have a child randomly choose a card from the basket and decode the Braille letters to read the Braille name.  The child whose name is on the card is then the next child to choose an index card.  (If a child chooses his or her own name card, he or she simply puts the card back in the basket and chooses a new card.)\nBooks in Braille\r\nMany school districts have collections of books in Braille for blind children.  Show several Braille books to your children and allow them to use their fingertips to \"read\" the letters on the pages.  If possible, invite a child or adult with moderate to severe blindness to visit your classroom to read a Braille book to your children.\nWhat's My Reward?\r\nChallenge children to read sentences in Braille.  On each of the sentence strips, write sentences using Braille dots that refer to a reward-oriented activity.  Allow a child to choose a prepared sentence strip, decode the sentence, and if decoded correctly, receive that written reward.  Some possible rewards are the following:\n\nTake free time to draw a picture.\nYou get to choose a sticker.\nRead a book with a friend.\nYou have earned time on the computer.\nYou may visit the library.\nYou get to be the class helper today.\nYou will be the line leader today.\n\n\nCreate Your Own Message\r\nFor this activity, each child needs a pencil, a sentence strip, and a bottle of white glue.  Have each child think of a message that he or she would like to write in Braille.   Have each child lightly print the message, using Braille dots on the sentence strip.  Next, the child creates each word by squeezing small dots of glue on the penciled dots.

        "Directions": "Gwendolyn Brooks was born in Kansas in 1917, with what she has described as two handicaps: she was both female and African American.  Yet, even as a child she was determined to succeed.  She began to write and send her poems to various publishers.  At eleven, she was a published poet!  Gwendolyn received almost no encouragement from her teachers and instructors, but she continued to write.\r\nAfter the publication of her first book in 1945, Gwendolyn became a recognized writer.  The American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Guggenheim Foundation gave her grants and fellowships.\r\nIn 1949 Gwendolyn wrote the book Annie Allen, which describes a young girl's growing up and the many problems she faces.  Annie Allen earned Brooks something no other African American woman had ever earned: the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry; Columbia University in New York has presented this award each year since 1922.  Only five women--none of them African American--had ever received the award.  This was a remarkable achievement for Gwendolyn Brooks.\r\nGwendolyn Brooks wrote shape poetry.  Introduce this type of poetry to students.  Shape poetry is when your poem is written inside the shape of the object about which you are writing.  The lines do not have to rhyme.  Choose an object from nature.  (Brooks wrote one poem about rain.)  You might choose a snowflake, a raindrop, or even a plant or an animal.  Draw an outline of that object, and fill in the outline with your thoughts.\r\nDistribute the activity sheet to students and have them try writing their own shape poems.",

        "Objective": "Students will learn about the history of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.",
        "Directions": "Background Information\r\nThe Jewish festival of Hanukkah, or Chanukah, is also called the Festival of Lights.  It lasts for eight days and usually occurs in December, although in some years it may start in November.  It commemorates not only the triumph of the Maccabees over the great army of the Syrian king, Antiochus IV, in 165 B.C., but also the universal message that all people have the right to be free.\r\nAfter the Jews won their battle, they went to their temple and found that the Syrians had brought in statues of their own gods.  The eternal light had been allowed to go out.  The Jews rekindled the light, but they had only enough oil to keep it burning for one day, and it would take eight days for a messenger to get more oil.  The miracle of Hanukkah is that the oil kept burning for eight days, long enough for the messenger to return with more.  Jews use a candleholder called the menorah to symbolize this miracle.  It holds nine candles.  One, the shammash, is used to light the others.  They stand for the eight days that the oil kept burning.\r\nHanukkah is celebrated by lighting the candles of the menorah, playing games of chance with a spinning top called a dreidel, and eating special holiday foods such as potato pancakes called latkes.  Children often receive a gift on each night of Hanukkah in addition to Hanukkah gelt (money).  This gelt sometimes consists of chocolate wrapped in gold foil to look like money.\nActivities\nGive a Hanukkah party in your classroom.  This can be very simple or very festive, but it should include at least one traditional food, some gelt, a chance to play the dreidel game, and the singing of some Hanukkah songs.  You can give one yourself with the help of a Jewish delicatessen.  Gelt can be purchased everywhere in its little net bags.  Directions for playing the dreidel game can be found below.  Read Hannukah stories.  Have children make Hanukkah hats to wear for the party.  Buy inexpensive plastic dreidels for your students or have each student make his or her own.\nBeautiful Hanukkah cards can be made easily.  Fold blue paper into a card shape.  Lay the cut-out shape of a candle on the front of the card.  Lightly sponge thin white tempera paint over the entire front.  Carefully lift away the candle.  Allow to dry and write a message inside.  \nLet children make a menorah using frosting and marshmallows.  Give each child a piece of tagboard 11 x 4 inches (28 cm x 10 cm), ten marshmallows, and nine candles.  Have the children spread some white frosting on the bottom of each marshmallow and then put them onto the tagboard.  With the frosting, \"glue\" a second marshmallow on top of the middle marshmallow to create the shammash or servant.'  Poke birthday candles into each marshmallow to create a menorah.\nSee the activity sheets for three other fun Hanukkah activities:  drawing a menorah, making a Star of David, and making a hanging dreidel\nDirections for the Dreidel Game\r\nCut out the dreidel.  Make holes as shown below.  Fold along the inside lines to make a box.  Fold the tabs inward.  Use glue or tape to hold the dreidel together.  Push a pencil or pen through the holes.  Spin the dreidel and begin play.\r\nTo Play the Game\r\nThe dreidel is a four-sided spinning top.  The letters written on the side of the dreidel are Hebrew for A Great Miracle Happened There.  Each symbol represents a different instruction for the game.  To play, give each person a designated number of markers (gelt, candy, nuts, etc.)  Each player puts one marker in the center, or kitty, each time the dreidel is spun.  Players take turns spinning the dreidel.  \r\nIf the dreidel lands on:\n",

It was built to honor George Washington, who was the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797.  It took nearly a century for the idea of this monument to become a reality.  The United States government was slow in finding money for the monument, so a group of private citizens in the 1830s raised the money to bring their dream to life.\r\nThe cornerstone of the monument was laid in 1848 with the same shovel Washington had used in 1793 to lay the cornerstone of the Capitol Building.  Construction on the Washington Monument took a long time.  Political tensions, lack of money, and the Civil War were responsible for several holds on the building process.  The monument was finally completed in 1884.\r\nThe Washington Monument is made of stone.  A pyramid made of aluminum sits on top of it.  The monument was modeled after a classic Egyptian obelisk.  At 555 feet (169 m) tall it is one of the tallest masonry structures in the world.  The inner walls of the monument are made of marble.  There are 896 steps leading to an observation room at the top.  Here, visitors can look out windows and see the Lincoln Memorial, the Capitol Building, the White House, and the Jefferson Memorial.\r\nDistribute the activity page and art materials, and allow students to create their own Washington Monuments.",

Marconi had studied sound waves for many years.  He created the wireless telegraphy and was successful in sending radio waves across the Atlantic Ocean, a distance of more than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers).  The messages that Marconi sent were in Morse code, a method of communication using dots and dashes or short and long clicking sounds which represent letters of the alphabet.\n\nCommunication Web\r\nAsk your students to think about the ways people communicate today.  How do we send messages to people we know?  How do we gather information about people and events in other countries?  Create a communication web by drawing a large circle labeled \"Communication.\"  Draw lines radiating from the circle and at the end of each line, write a different form of communication we use in daily life, such as the telephone, the television, the radio, letters, newspapers, and magazines.\r\nImpact of the Invention\r\nAsk your children to share why they think the wireless telegraphy was an important invention.  How did people communicate before this invention?\r\nHow Radio Waves Work\r\nDemonstrate to your students how radio waves behave with the following activities:\n\nTie a length of rope to a stationary pole (such as a tetherball pole).  Holding the free end of the rope, manipulate it so that the rope continually moves in an \"S\" shape.\nLine up six croquet balls (one behind the other) for this experiment.  Hit the end ball with a croquet mallet.  Observe how the ball at the opposite end moves off while the others stay in place.\nFill a shallow pan with water.  Drop a marble into the center of the pan and watch the waves ripple outward from the center of the water.  This can also be done by placing a clear glass or plastic pan of water atop an overhead projector.  All children will be able to see the water ripples on the screen.\n\n\nSound Investigations\r\nHave children work in pairs to investigate sound.  Give them the following directions:\n\nFind out which travels faster, light or sound.  How fast do they travel?  How fast do radio waves travel?\nConduct experiments to find out if sound can travel through water, walls, tables, soft materials, etc.  Record your results and share your findings with your classmates.\nDistribute the activity sheets to students.\n",

        "Directions": "Background Information\r\nIn the late 1930s, the first television was demonstrated at the New York World's Fair.  During the 1940s, very few people owned television sets and very few programs existed.  However, by the 1950s, televisions existed in millions of homes and brought about tremendous changes in society.  Television changed the way people lived.  They stayed at home more and gathered around the TV for meals.  People were able to see firsthand a variety of events happening across the country.  News, events, and even advertising found their way into the homes of millions of Americans by the late 1950s.\n\nProcedure\nWhat's Good about Television?\r\nThere are many wonderful things about television and the programs it brings into our homes.  Provide each child with a copy of the television pattern on page 30 and have each child write thoughts about this invention.  Use some of the prompts below to inspire your children's writings.\n\nWhat do you learn from television?\nHow does it help you learn about the world?\nWhat programs do your family members like to watch?\nHow does the television affect your family?  Do you watch it together?  Does it cause arguments?\nWrite about your favorite programs.\nAre there bad things about television?\n\n\r\nExtension Ideas\n\nViewing Graph\r\nAsk students to determine the number of hours each day that he or she spends watching television.  You may need to provide the children with program guides to help them determine the length of the shows they regularly watch.  Gather the information and create a class pie graph showing the number of hours spent in front of the TV..\n\nWhat Can We Do?\r\nBefore the 1950s children did not have television to watch.  They participated in lots of other activities to fill their time.  Using magazine cutouts, have each child create a collage of activities that they can do for entertainment other than watching TV.",

        "Directions": "Before students begin the activity, discuss the history of Thanksgiving with them.\r\nThanksgiving was first observed by the Pilgrims in the year 1621.  The Pilgrims had just survived their first difficult winter in the new settlement near present-day Provincetown, Massachusetts.  The Pilgrims made friends with the Native Americans who taught them to build stronger houses and hunt for food.  When spring arrived, the Pilgrims went to work plowing the land and planting seeds brought from England.  One Native American, Squanto, became especially helpful to the Pilgrims.\r\nWhen harvest time came, the Pilgrims discovered that they had more than enough produce to store for the next winter.  The Pilgrims were so grateful that they decided to hold a feast of thanksgiving, inviting their Native American friends.  The Native Americans brought shellfish, game, and wild turkeys.  The Pilgrims filled the tables with bounty from their gardens.  They all bowed their heads and said a prayer of thanks to God before beginning the feast which lasted three days.\r\nToday, Thanksgiving is celebrated in America on the fourth Thursday of November.  Families gather together to share a special meal and to thank God for all the good that has been given them.\r\nDistribute the Thanksgiving Coupon Book activity pages to students and tell them that the first Thanksgiving was characterized by a spirit of sharing and cooperation.  Have them create their coupon books to give to someone for whom they are thankful.\r\nAdditional Activities\r\nGrouping Turkey Feathers: Buy a package of brightly colored feathers (found in craft stores).  Have children group the feathers that are alike in color.\r\nBuilding Log Cabins: Build some log cabins for the Pilgrim family out of wooden building logs.  Make a Pilgrim family.  Stand up the characters to complete the scene!\r\nMaking Foam and Pipe-Cleaner Turkeys: Spray paint a foam ball brown.  Let dry.  Push in colored pipe cleaners for turkey feathers and feet.  (Remember to spray paint outside or in a well-ventilated area.)\r\nStringing Popcorn Necklaces: Provide each child with a needle and strong cotton thread approximately 20 \" (50 cm) long, and popcorn flakes.  Tie off the two ends of the thread when the necklace is long enough to go over the child's head.\r\nComparing Thanksgivings: Read a book that tells about the first Thanksgiving and the conditions under which the Pilgrims lived.  Make a Venn diagram or a chart comparing Thanksgiving then and now.\r\nTo emphasize a spirit of cooperation and good behavior, fill out a \"Thankful Certificate\" for each child.  The adult completes the award by filling in the page with a comment such as \"I am thankful that you were a good friend\" or \"I am thankful that your work showed improvement.\"  The certificates are awarded at the end of the month and can be presented as part of a celebration feast.",

You may also wish to make an overhead transparency of it to model how the data is recorded for each graph activity.\nReproduce the small, medium, and large pasta patterns (pages 41 and 42) on green, blue, red, and yellow paper or cardstock and cut them apart.  Make one set of pasta patterns for each small group or pair of students.  The number of each color, size, and type of pasta can vary.  Place the patterns in envelopes  or reclosable plastic bags, making all of the sets exactly the same.  If you prefer, students can use real pasta for these sorting activities.  To change the color of real pasta, place 15 drops of food coloring and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) rubbing alcohol in a container with a lid.  Shake the container.  Remove the colored pasta and allow it to dry.  The amount of food color affects the brightness of the color.\r\n    Directions:\n\nDivide the class into small groups or assign partners.  First have students sort the pasta into groups by color.  Ask them to count how many pasta pieces there are for each color (green, blue, red, yellow) and record the data on their tables.\nUse the floor or wall graph to model the activity.  Show students how to mark the scale along the bottom, counting by ones or twos.  Help them place the bars on the graph.  Then ask them to record the results on their bar graphs (page 43), using colors that match the pasta groups.\nNext have students sort the pasta into groups by size.  Ask them to count how many pasta pieces there are for each size (small, medium, large) and record the data on their tables.\nAsk students to record the results on their bar graphs (page 44).  Discuss how to mark the scale on the left-hand side, counting by ones or twos.\nNow have students sort the pasta into groups by type.  Ask them to count how many pasta pieces there are for each type and record the data on their tables.\nAsk students to record the results on their bar graphs.  Show them how to mark the scale along the bottom, counting by ones or twos.\nDiscuss the questions (pages 43-45) and ask additional ones to check students' understanding.\n\n\r\n    Extension Activities:\n\nTeach students about probability, using the pasta patterns.  After determining the number of each color, size, and type of pasta, have students replace the patterns in the bags or envelopes.  Then have students make predictions about which color, size, and/or type of pasta is most or least likely to be drawn or which ones have an equal chance.\nCreate pictographs, using the pasta patterns (pages 41 and 42).\nHave students make pasta salad for snack.  Be sure to ask parents if their children have any food allergies or dietary restrictions.\n\n",

        "Directions": "Creating Graphs\r\nGraphing a type of food or food preference can be effective means of teaching students about graphs.  One method of graphing is to write a question on the board or on a poster.  The question should be written exactly as it appears on the student's paper.  Ask the students to create graphs using a variety of methods, depending upon what is most efficient in your classroom.  For example, if you have a white board, you may write the question and have each student use a dry-erase marker to graph the information that provides the answer.  If you use a chalkboard, you may write the question and provide students with sticky notes to use as data markers.  They can then write their names on their sticky notes, come up to the board, and place their votes on the class graph.  \r\nAnother effective method of creating a graph is to write the graph question on poster board or chart paper and have each student contribute to the graph by gluing on a piece of cut paper, coloring in the information on the graph, or using a sticky note to indicate a preference.  An overhead projector can also be used as a means of creating a graph and presenting results.  Students can actually contribute their data on an overhead transparency and share it with the class.\r\nAfter data has been collected, students should transfer the information to their individual papers.  Once this is done, they need to communicate as much about the data as they can.  It is most beneficial to do several class graphs without paperwork prior to having the students use their pencils.  By doing this, students begin to develop vocabulary that can later be used to express their observations about the class graphs.  While discussing the results of the graph, use words like most, least, similar, total, difference, and conclusion.  This vocabulary becomes a natural part of their answers when they get used to hearing it.\r\nYou may want to delay providing the snack until immediately after the graph is finished.  Presenting the most popular snack according to the graph is one more way to show students the value of real-life information and how their decisions and votes do have an impact.\r\nThe way the information is represented is not as important as the interpretation of the graph data.\r\nThe key to graphing activities is to make them important to the students.  When students realize that graphing is another safe environment in which to communicate about math, their interest peaks.",

Once students or groups of students become comfortable using one strategy, you may want to choose one of the following strategies to expand their strategy choices.\r\nThe following are methods that students may choose to solve the question for which they are seeking the answer.\nAct It Out\r\nStudents can use the problem like a script and act out the question.  For example, they can actually hand out five candies to each person and see what happens.\nSolve a Simpler Problem\r\nStudents can use smaller numbers or a less demanding equation to figure out their solution.  While recreating a problem, the student can look for number patterns.\nDraw a Diagram\r\nStudents can draw a representation of the problem to help them visualize the process for solving.  This method seems to be the most common among primary students.  Their diagrams may take the form of a circle with tallies, or they may be actual pictures of grapes being crossed out to show subtraction.  Choose this method so they can see the relation between numbers and actual \"things.\"\nMake a Chart or Table\r\nStudents can create tables or charts to organize the pictures or number information.  Once they have the organization, the patterns they are seeking are sometimes more visible.  Many students prefer a blank graph sheet to help them arrange their data.  They may find it difficult to draw straight lines, so provide that paper for them if they need it.\nFind a Pattern\r\nBy using numbers on their papers or numbers on the hundreds chart, students can look for patterns to help them come up with the next logical number in a sequence or pattern.\nMake a Physical Model\r\nStudents may need to use actual manipulatives to solve and work through their problem-solving processes.  It is important to allow students to use whichever math tools they deem most beneficial.  Sometimes, it is the actual snack that can help the students the most when they are allowed the chance to manipulate it.\nGuess/Check/Revise\r\nStudents are encouraged to make an educated guess at the possible outcome to the question.  They can then use what they already know about numbers to check their early attempts at solutions.  If it is necessary, they can revise their answers.  It is important to note that students may use several strategies to prove their solutions are either right or wrong.\nWork Backwards\r\nSometimes the answer is in front of the students, and they need to work their way backwards to find the final solution to the questions they are trying to answer.  This is also a great technique to help students justify their answers by using a different strategy.\r\nIt is important that students have the opportunity to experiment with different strategies and that students are given the opportunity to communicate their efforts.  Every student can express his or her thoughts about mathematics.  Some students communicate with numbers, and others communicate with words.  The important consideration here is that students develop more critical thinking skills and the ability to reach and explain a viable solution to any problem-solving situation.  The activities in Math Snacks are designed to encourage this development.",

        "Description": "Science, Life Science",
        "Objective": "Students will learn about echolocation.",
        "Directions": "Background\r\nEcholocation is the method that some bats use to catch insects and other moving creatures.  They are able to use sound waves to determine where the insect is.  When a bat is hunting it makes a series of high-pitched sounds.  The sound waves travel through the air and bounce off of objects.  When the sound waves return to the bat it can tell the bat where the object is.  A bat can use sound waves to tell the difference between objects that are stationary or moving.  For example, a bat uses sound waves to avoid hitting a tree and immediately afterwards uses sound waves to catch a mosquito.  Bats probably have the best techniques for echolocation of any animal on earth.  The sounds they make are often much higher than the human ear can hear.\r\nHow do sound waves travel back to a bat?  It is similar to how a mirror reflects light.  If you hold a small mirror in your hand and maneuver it in the sunlight you can see the light reflecting off of the mirror and onto other objects.  This is similar to how sound waves are reflected.  The bat emits a high-frequency sound.  The sound waves hit an object and are then reflected back to the bat.  This high-tech system allows bats to fly in total darkness.  They not only see where they are going, but can also catch their prey.  When you look at pictures of bats you can see that many have large ears and interesting nose shapes.  Some bats use their ears to catch sound waves and other bats use their odd-shaped noses to direct sound waves.\nActivities\n\nProvide your children with hand mirrors and take them outside on a sunny day.  Ask each child to reflect the sunlight off of the mirror and onto the sidewalk, side of a wall, or the school building.  Ask the child to think about how the mirror is reflecting the light.  Explain that bats reflect sound waves off of objects in much the same way.  (Note: Warn the children to not reflect the light directly back towards anyone's eyes or face.)\nGather the children around you and ask them to look at the size of their classmates' ears in comparison to their bodies.  Show pictures of bats with large ears and ask the children to compare the size of the ears to the bats' bodies.  Remind the children that megabats have small ears and microbats have large ears.  Scientists divide bats into two groups-megabats and microbats.  There are about 200 kinds of megabats and about 800 kinds of microbats.  Megabats have large eyes and excellent eyesight.  Most megabats have short, round ears.  Most megabats eat fruit and have a good sense of smell so that they can find ripened fruit.  They can have wingspans up to six feet (1.90 meters).  They roost together in trees and wrap their wings around themselves to keep warm.  Microbats are generally smaller than megabats with wingspans up to five inches (13cm).  They have large ears and small eyes.  Most microbats eat insects and use echolocation to hunt.  Their ears and noses come in a variety of shapes and sizes.\nAre humans more like megabats or microbats?  Have the children cup their hands around their ears.  Continue talking to the children and ask if they notice a difference in the loudness of your voice.  Ask them to tell why they think the sound is louder.  Provide each child with a large paper circle (with approximately a 12 inches [30 cm] diameter) that has been cut in half.  Ask the children to cup one half-circle paper around each ear to form a pair of larger ears.  Talk to the children for a few minutes with their larger ears in place.  Be certain to not talk louder than when the children initially listened to your voice.  Ask them to share how you sounded to them this time.  Did your voice sound louder?  Explain to children that their enlarged ears were able to collect more sound waves which improves their hearing.\nComplete the activity sheet about the bats' noses as a class.  Work together to match the names with the bat noses.  If necessary, you can use reference books or the Internet to find the answers.\n",

        "Directions": "Teacher Information\r\nSome plants produce two kinds of flowers on the same plant.  One will have only stamens, the other only pistils.  These are incomplete flowers.  There are also composite flowers (such as dandelions and marigolds) which consist of many complete flowers clustered into one.  The flowers used for this activity should have both stamens and a pistil, known as a complete flower.  These include flowers like the lily, gladiola, tulip, and fruit blossoms.  Select the largest flowers for this lesson and provide a variety of them.\nActivity\nAsk the students if they know how seeds are produced.  Tell them they are about to take a flower apart so they can see where seeds are formed.  If the students are too young to dissect flowers alone, do this activity as a demonstration.\nDistribute data sheets, flowers, magnifiers, and clear tape to students and let them follow the data sheets as they dissect the flower.\nClosure\nUse the transparency How Flowers Reproduce to explain the reproduction process to students.  Tell them bees are the best pollinators of flowers.  When a bee goes to a flower to get nectar and pollen, some pollen drops off the bee's body onto the sticky stigma on the pistil.  Beekeepers often rent hives to farms with apple orchards or other trees needing to be pollinated.  Other insects which visit flowers also pollinate them.  Pollen can also be transferred to the stigma by wind and by some birds and bats.\nExplain that fruits and vegetables are really swollen ovaries of a blossom that grew on the plant.  Show students an apple and point out the leftover blossom and stem on opposite ends.  Cut the apple open to expose the seeds formed inside the ovary.  Let the students examine the seeds. \nSave the students' flower parts to be used in the next lesson and in the plant journal.\nExtension\nTake students on a walk to search for fruit-bearing plants that show blossoms and fruit.  Try to find examples of the transition from blossom to fruit on a plant.  Cut open a blossom to expose the swollen ovary inside, the beginning of the fruit.\nHave students examine a dandelion flower and one which has gone to seed.  This is a great example of a composite flower.  Each seed is formed in its own flower but combined with others.",

The light entering the eye falls on the retina that lines the back and sides of the eyeball.  Cells in the layers absorb the light and convert it to electrical signals.  These travel through nerves to the brain where they are interpreted as color.\r\nTo prepare for the lesson, make sets of six plastic cups for each group, labeled as follows: red + green, green + blue, blue + yellow, red + yellow, blue + red, and yellow + green.  Fill the cups nearly full of water.  For each group, make a tray of the following materials: set of six cups of water, labeled with colors; six toothpicks; paper towel; one green and one yellow crayon; and two blue and two red crayons.\r\n(If the activity is too complex for this class, arrange for adults or older students to work with each group as needed.)\r\nShow the students red, green, blue, and yellow food coloring and have them tell you the names of the colors.

The  differences in pressure causes the movement of air or winds.  If a pressure difference exists, air moves from the higher pressure to the lower pressure area, in order to even out the pressure.  If the high pressure center is close to a low pressure center, the movement from the high pressure to the low pressure is faster and the winds will move faster.  The larger the pressure difference, the stronger the winds are.  Instruments such as anemometers or wind gauges are used to measure the speed and strength of the wind.\nMeasuring the Wind 2 (Page 40)\r\nThe direction of the wind is determined by the direction the wind is coming from and not the direction it is blowing to.  Instruments such as weather vanes and windsocks can measure the direction of the wind.\nWind Power (Page 41)\r\nUsing the wind for power is a good idea because it does not cause pollution.

First and second grade students can refer to adjectives as describing words.By using adjectives, we can add meaning and interest to sentences.\nExamples:\r\nThe kind girl showed the old lady the way.\r\nThe savage dog chased the frightened boy. \r\nThe playful dog chased the laughing boy.\r\nThe rude girl shoved the disabled lady.\n\r\nChildren should be encouraged to think about the adjectives they choose and to steer away from adjectives that have become meaningless through overuse, such as \"nice\" and \"good.\"\nExamples:\r\nIt was a nice day. It was a sunny day.\r\nThat was a good story. That was an exciting story.\n\r\nLike \"nice\" and \"good,\" these are also considered overused adjectives that should be replaced with more exact choices:  fine, grand, funny, awful, lovely, terrible, crazy, adorable, sweet, cool, cute.\n\nTeaching Strategies\r\nDescribe the picture \r\nDisplay a large poster to the class. Have children orally describe the different objects and people featured in the picture.\n\n\n\n What color is the bird?   \n The bird is yellow.   \n\n\n What type of tree is it?   \n It is a big, shady tree.   \n\n\n What colors are the flowers?   \n They are purple and red.   \n\n\n\n\r\nCharacter words \r\nAfter reading a story to children, ask them to provide describing words for the characters.\r\nWhat kind of person was Cinderella?\r\nWhat words could we use to describe the ugly stepsisters?\r\nWhat adjectives will help paint a picture of the prince?\r\nDescribe the noun \r\nHave children suggest adjectives to describe nouns you have written on the chalkboard.

Cut out the alphabet squares.  Gather together all of the remaining materials.\n\r\nLesson Plan\n Prewriting\n\nIntroduce alphabet poems by having students create an alphabetized list about a favorite topic.  You may use the Alphabet Poem Brainstorming worksheet or create a list on the board with the entire class.  Choose a topic such as \"All About Me\" for individual students or \"Our School\" for the whole class.\nDistribute one letter square from Alphabet Squares to each student. (Start the alphabet over again if you have more than 26 students, or have students work in pairs.)\nTell the students to think of a word that starts with their letters, one that relates to the chosen topic.  They may write the word on the back of their alphabet squares or dictate them to someone.\n\n Drafting\n\nOn the board or chart paper, write the class alphabet poem by calling each letter of the alphabet in order.  The students, or pairs, can call out their words, or they may come up to write them on the board or chart on the appropriate line.\nWhen all the assigned letters have been called and the words added to the poem, read the poem aloud.  Congratulate the students for having written a poem together.  If the poem was written on chart paper, you may wish to have students create illustrations to be glued around the border of the poem.\nGenerate a discussion among the students about how they created the poem.  What did they do first?  What did they do next?  How did they think of words to fit?  What did they do last?\nDistribute the Alphabet Poem Brainstorming worksheet to the students.  Tell them to select a topic and to brainstorm words that relate to it.\nWhen students are ready, distribute the Alphabet Poem Draft worksheet.  Have the students write their own alphabet poems on the worksheet.  Younger students will need to dictate their poems. \n\n Revising/Editing\n\nThe students should share their alphabet poems with responders from class (this may be done orally in small groups for pre-readers).  The responders' feedback can be recorded on the Response and Assessment sheet.  \nEncourage students to make any changes they wish, after receiving feedback and before writing a final draft.\n\n Publishing\n\nPost the class-generated alphabet poem, along with the illustrations, in a place where all the students can see it.\nStudents may wish to use letters cut from magazines and newspapers to illustrate their individual, or partner alphabet poems.  Copies of these poems would make a good classroom book for a writing center.\n\r\nContent Connections for Alphabet Poems\n\r\nLanguage Arts\r\nMake a list of your classmates in alphabetical order.  After each student's name, write a positive word to describe him or her that begins with that letter of the alphabet.  For example:  Steven-Smart, Kyra-Kind.\n\nMath\r\nAssign each letter of the alphabet a number in order.  Create some math equations using letters instead of numbers, for example:  A + A = B (1 + 1 = 2).\n\nSocial Studies\r\nChoose a topic from the social studies unit you are studying.  See for how many letters of the alphabet you can find a related word.  Put the words in alphabetical order and you will have a social studies alphabet poem.\n\r\nFine Arts\r\nListen to lots of different music and make a list of all the different ways you might move to it, such as sway, hop, wiggle, etc.  When you have enough words, arrange them in alphabetical order to write a musical movement alphabet poem.",

Every paragraph, like every story or book, has a beginning, a middle, and an end.\nGive students some of the basics of paragraphs: The beginning of a paragraphbegins with a topic sentence.  The topic sentence tells the reader what the paragraph will be about.  I have a dog is a topic sentence, but it is not as interesting as I have a talking dog.  The second sentence gives readers more information about what the paragraph will be about and will make them want to read it.\nIn the middle of the paragraph, each sentence will be about the topic.  If the topic is your talking dog, you won't have a sentence telling about your math test.  Instead you might write My dog knows how to say I love you and ice cream.  You might also want to tell how the dog learned the words. The last sentence of your paragraph is the concluding sentence, or closing sentence.  This sentence will remind your reader of what you are talking about and what the topic means to you.  You might end your paragraph about your talking dog by saying It may not seem like he is talking like humans do, but if you listen closely and have some cheese, you will hear the words, and you will be amazed!\nPractice writing paragraphs with students before they begin working on their activity sheets.

        "Objective": "Students use journals to develop their writing skills.",
        "Directions": "Journals and SSW\r\nSustained Silent Writing (SSW) is similar to Sustained Silent Reading (SSR).  It is a specific time each day set aside for the children to practice writing that is ungraded.  The children, however, are expected to do their best work.\n\r\nSharing writing encourages children to develop their writing skills.  It is useful to use a variety of methods to allow children to share their work.\r\nStudents can share their writing in the following ways:\n\nwith the partner next to him or her\nwith the whole group\nwith the partner across from him or her\nwith a partner of choice\nwith a partner drawn at random\nwith a small group\nin a \"donut\" (One group of children forms a circle with their backs to the middle, and the other children form a circle around them.)\n\n\r\nSSW can be done in a journal used expressly for that purpose.  Journals can be made by stapling several pieces of paper between construction paper covers.  The children can be given a new journal each month.  Different colored construction paper each month makes the journals easy to organize.  Monthly journals can be sent home to be shared at the end of each month with a letter to the parents requesting that they be returned the next day.  If desired, you can also ask the parents to write a response to the journals before returning them.  Their responses can be addressed to their children.\n\r\nThe following information is geared toward the use of journals in specific grade levels.  Use these as guidelines for having students complete October Writing Journals.\n\nKindergarten\r\nBegin by using blank paper on which the children draw a picture.  Sharing their pictures with classmates gives them an audience for whom to draw and helps them to develop their verbal skills.  The next step is for them to use a word or words to label their pictures.  Afterwards, they can begin to use paper with one or more writing lines, drawing a picture and writing about it on the line(s).  Support the children's use of \"kindergarten spelling\" (writing the letters whose sounds they hear when they say the word).  This is a normal and vital step toward the development of conventional spelling.\n\nFirst Grade\r\nIn first grade, children build upon their kindergarten experience.  If they did not experience journal writing in kindergarten, begin with blank paper of pictures and labels.  Decrease the size of the picture portion of the page each month, completely eliminating the picture portion by midyear.  Since the emphasis of SSW after the first month of school should be clearly be writing, encourage children to write before they draw a picture.  Support the children's use of \"first grade spelling\" (writing any letter sounds they hear when they say the word).  Again, this is a normal and necessary step to conventional spelling.\n\nSecond Grade\r\nThe children will again build on their prior experiences, using a format similar to that used at the end of the first grade.  If the children have not had previous journal writing experiences, begin during the first month with paper allowing a small picture area.  Move to a fully lined page during the following months.  Support the children's use of \"second grade spelling\"  (writing conventionally any words they have previously learned and writing down letter sounds they hear when they say the word for any others).  This step brings them very close to complete conventional spelling.\n\nThird Grade\r\nBy third grade, the students should have had a fair amount of writing experience.  Build on this prior experience, using a format similar to what was used at the end of second grade.  Provide fully lined paper for their writing, forgoing drawing in lieu of complete writing content.  Require a reasonable amount of conventional spelling, allowing for invented spellings wherever necessary so as not to interrupt the flow of ideas onto paper.  Remember, spelling can always be corrected, and the primary purpose of sustained writing is to encourage fluidity of thought and expression.  Stopping to look up words in the dictionary will sometimes block that flow.",

Note: If the definitions offered by the Internet site are written at a reading level that is too difficult for children to decipher on their own, consider having them use the companion site, pairing students, or doing the entire activity as a class.\n\nExtension Ideas\r\nAnytime the students come across a word they do not know in their reading or daily life, challenge them to predict its definition, and then use the classroom computer to look up the word.  Create a New Words sheet for students to record new words, their predicted definitions, and their actual definitions.  Keep the sheets by the computer.  Also, bookmark the dictionary site on the classroom computer and show students how to access it so you do not have to interrupt what you are doing to help them define a word.  \n\r\nConsider designating one student the Word Hunter--the person who can use the classroom computer to look up words--when the entire class is reading together, or anytime the entire class comes across an unfamiliar word.\n\r\nIf your students are comfortable doing so, allow them to use a search engine to find their spelling/vocabulary words used in context on other sites.

Science fiction is a story based on science where life as we know it has been dramatically changed.  Sometimes it is the characters that have been altered (aliens, dinosaurs, etc.), or the setting (outer space, earth with different surroundings, the moon, etc.). \nBrainstorm with your class a list of things that if scientifically changed would alter the way we live our lives.  (What if our clocks stopped working? or everyone's skin turned green? or the sun stayed up night and day? etc.)  Make a list of these changes on the chalkboard.  Have each student select one change to write a science fiction story about.\n\nDrafting\n\nDistribute copies of Science Fiction Outline to students.  Have students answer the questions to prepare for writing their science fiction stories.\nWhen students have finished the work sheet, have them write the drafts of their science fiction stories.  Go over the criteria for the science fiction story (see objective above).  Clarify with students the expectations for these stories.\n\nEditing and Revising\n\nWhen the stories are drafted, pair students up with a partner, and have students read each others' stories.  Provide Science Fiction Peer Assessment for this purpose.  Partners should check to make sure that all the criteria for the science fiction story have been met.\nFollowing the peer editing, students should make any necessary changes and revisions before writing the final copies of the stories.\n\nPublishing and Assessment\n\nStudents should type their drafts, using a word-processing program on the computer.  Students could illustrate their final copies with a picture of a character or the scenery.\nUse Science Fiction Teacher Assessment to evaluate the final copies of the science fiction stories.\n",

        "Directions": "Pre-Internet Activity:\r\nHave the students brainstorm everything they know about frogs.  Record their responses in a pond drawn on chart paper.  Review the list at the end of the brainstorming session.  If the class thinks the statement is true, they jump like a frog once.  If they disagree with the statement or think it is false, they make a croaking sound.  Explain that they will have a chance to learn more about frogs on the Internet as well as practice identifying synonyms.\n\r\nTeaching the Lesson:\nPlay this synonym review game.  Using the list of synonyms below (or any others you have), call out a pair of words.  Since the words are synonyms, the students hop like frogs to someone else's seat.  Be sure to include some word pairs that are not synonyms.  When non-synonym pairs of words are called, the students simply \"gribbet\" like a frog and wait for a synonym pair to be called so they may hop along to the next desk. Go online to learn more about frogs at one of the suggested Web sites listed below.  A cute idea is to use a fly swatter since frogs are known to like flies.  To do this, hand a fly swatter to one student as his/her clue to come to the computer and explore the Web sites.  After connecting to a few links, he/she hands the swatter to another student who may do the same, and so on. Distribute a copy of page 40 to each student to complete independently.  You might have the students work on this while some are at the computers. You can label the frog and lily pad patterns (in the PDF file) with the synonym pairs for students to practice during center time.\n\r\nExtended Activity:\r\nPost the list of synonyms for the students to see.  Working with partners, have them devise a short script about frogs, using one of the synonym pairs.  First, they should consider the characters of their skits.  They can pretend to be frogs, two friends talking about frogs, scientists studying frogs, high school students dissecting frogs, etc.  Then they should consider their settings: the pond, aquarium, lab, school, etc.  Finally, they write their two-synonym skits keeping their characters and settings in mind.  After the partners perform for the class, the class members should identify who they were, where the skit took place, and the two synonyms they included.\n\r\nList of sample synonyms:\r\nill and sick\r\nfast and quick\r\nexit and leave\r\neasy and simple\r\nhard and difficult\r\nfunny and amusing\r\nharm and damage\r\nclose and shut\r\nbuy and purchase\r\nwalk and step\r\nhop and jump\r\nbig and large\r\nfat and chubby\r\nsly and clever\r\nold and aged\r\nsearch and seek\r\nsmell and odor\r\nstare and gaze\r\nhappy and glad\r\nsmart and wise",

The students might write about a new math concept, a new set of spelling words, a field trip, a school assembly, etc.  This will involve the students in writing in a non-threatening manner.  This activity might also help open up parent-child communication.  When the students go home and their parents ask, \"What did you learn today?\", the students will have an answer instead of the usual, \"Nothing!\"\n\r\nIf you should choose to do this activity as a whole class, copy the record on page 29 on chart paper or make an overhead transparency copy.  The chart paper can be laminated, and the students can use erasable pens to write on the laminated chart paper.  At the end of the week, just spray the chart with window cleaner and wipe off the sentences.  If you are using an overhead projector, photocopy the transparency at the end of the week.  Send home a copy with each student.  This will help keep the parents informed about what is happening in the classroom.\n\r\nAbout halfway through the year, the students can begin making their own copies of The Daily News.  As a whole class, talk about the different things that happened during the day.  Each student can then write his or her own sentence about the day.

The objects or props you use when studying dinosaurs, such as model dinosaurs or fossil specimens, are called \"realia.\"\n\r\nThis realia is very important when children are involved in object writing.  There are two different object-writing types.  The first one deals with children writing about their own personal experiences with the subject.  For example, children may be asked to wear their favorite T-shirts and then write about the shirts; where they got them, what makes them so special, etc.  The second type of object writing deals with \"anthropomorphism\" or ascribing human form or attributes to a nonhuman thing or being.  For example, many pet owners do this with their pets, treating them more like small human babies, talking to them, cuddling them, etc.\n\r\nFor young writers, beginning object-writing lessons consist of fill-in stories.  This gives them guidelines and experience in reading complete sentences in a beginning-to-ending format, which tells detailed information about the writing subject. \n\r\nThis anthropomorphic object writing activity has specific directions for students to follow.  This kind of writing can be challenging for children because it requires writing complete sentences.  You may want to enlist the help of adult volunteers or cross-age peers, to help the children fill in their story ideas. \n\r\nIf possible, bring in a leaf for each child to place on his or her desk while completing the activity.",

Tell them that it can be fun to add to a story that is written by a team of writers.\r\nHere is how to do it with your whole class:\n\n\nDistribute the Team Stories page of story starters to each student.  Each student can take out a piece of paper.  Students can use one of the story starters to begin their stories.  Ask them if they can think of ways to make it interesting.  Have students copy the story starter of their choice and then write another paragraph or two to continue the story.  They should add a title at the top of their stories.\nWhen they have finished, have them look carefully to make sure other people will be able to read what you wrote.\nWhen time is up, have them stop and turn in their stories.\nAfter you have collected the stories, make copies of what students have written so far.\nNext, on a different day if time is limited, pass out the stories.  Each student should have one that someone else wrote.\nGive them time to write the middle part of someone else's story.  They should be sure to use the same characters that are in the beginning of the story and decide how it will continue.\n7.Have them make sure your middle can be read by others and turn it in.  Make copies of the new, longer stories.\nFinally, it will be time to write the endings to the stories.  Pass out the stories again.  Be sure that they get stories that were written by other students.\nNow students have the tough job of writing an ending to stories that they did not start.  They should be sure to use the same characters and write an ending that makes sense.\nCollect all of the stories.  The entire class can have a story festival, sharing the team stories.\n\n\nThe Story Festival\r\nState the title of the first story to be read.  The author of that story's beginning will come up to read the whole story.  When students hear the titles they wrote, they will go to the front of the class to read the team's story.  They may be surprised at what happened to their stories.  When students finish reading the whole story, they may wish to tell the class how they thought the story would go and what surprised them about the middle and ending.\n\r\nWhen everyone is finished, discuss the stories.  Did anyone have trouble continuing a story?  Why?  Did any story come out just as expected?  What were you thinking or feeling as you were writing your story parts?  Which was the most fun: the beginning, the middle, or the ending?  Which was the easiest to write? \n\nChallenge\r\nCreate report folders with about 10 pages each.  Each student can write a story start on the first page and add his or her name to the bottom of the page.  Put the folder in a box or on a shelf with story folders for the entire class.  When students  have some free time, they  can take out another folder, add a page to whatever story had been started, and add their name to the bottom of that page.  Tell them not to write their pages one after another; but to be sure to allow someone else a turn in between.  They can write in as many books as they like.  If they wish to, they can add illustrations to the page.  Tell them not to forget to read the stories too.\n\nFor Younger Students\r\nHave the class, or a team of students, sit in a circle.  Allot a time period, and pick a number so that students can try to guess the number.  The student who comes closest gets to begin.  The first student starts the story by introducing the characters and the setting, begins to tell some of the action, and then stops.  The student to his or her left takes up where the first student left off and stops to allow the next student to continue, and so on.  Continue as many times around the circle as time allows.  (If you use a timer, let students see how much time is left, and it may motivate them to start tying together loose ends to create a conclusion.)",

During the American Civil War (1861-1865), while the United States was fighting internally over the slavery issue and economics, Europeans decided to invade Mexico to collect some bad debts.  France also wanted an empire, so in 1862, they sent an army to take over Mexico.\r\nBenito Juarez, the first president of Mexico (who was also a Zapotec Indian) resisted the French invasion, rallying the Mexican people to resist.  The Battle of Pueblo took place on May 5, 1862.  The Mexican Army, under General Ignacio Zaragoza, defeated the well-trained French Army with poor Indian peasants.  The victory proved that the French were not invincible.  The French \"empire\" in Mexico collapsed five years later when Emperor Maximilian was executed.\r\nAlong with the music and dances of Mexico that play a big part in any Cinco de Mayo celebration, the flag of Mexico is displayed.\r\nThe Legend of the Mexican Flag\r\nThe Mexican flag dates back to 1821.  It is divided into three vertical sections.  The left section is solid green for independence.  The center section is white for religious purity.  The right section is red for national unity.\r\nIn the middle of the center section is the Mexican coat of arms.  This symbol depicts an eagle perched on a cactus and devouring a snake.  This symbol is borrowed from an Aztec legend.  The Aztecs were latecomers to the central plateau of Mexico.  When they arrived from the north around 1325, most of the land was already divided among the tribes who had already been living there.  The Aztecs believed that their deity Huitzilopochtli had given them a vision: that when they saw an eagle devouring a snake while perched on a cactus, they would be home.  They spotted this on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco.  It is here that they established their home of Tenochtitlan.  \r\nWhen the conquistadors arrived in 1519, Tenochtitlan was larger than the great cities of Europe.  Today, as then, it is the largest city in the world.  \n\nDirections for Flag\n\nColor the flag on page 109 according  to the legend.\nCut the flag out and tape it to a ruler  or dowel.\nWave your flag and cheer for Mexico.\n\nDirections for Coat of Arms\n\nCut out the coat of arms on page 110.\nTape or glue it to a large piece of paper for a \"Class Coat of Arms.\"\n",

        "Directions": "Lesson Preparation\n\nSet up stations for students to rotate through using the information on the data sheets.  If possible, set up duplicates of each station to have fewer students at each of them.\nTest each of the stations and adjust the setup as needed to match the students' ability levels.\nEstablish a rotation system which will allow at least 15 minutes at each station.\nArrange for adult or older student volunteers to be assigned to each station to assist the students as needed, if they are not able to do the work alone.\n\n\nActivity\n\nIntroduce the students to each of the stations.  Explain the instructions which they are to follow as they work at each of them.  Demonstrate how they are to use the materials at the various stations.\nDivide the students into groups of three or four students and assign each group to begin at a different station.  Allow sufficient time for each group to explore the materials at their station before moving them on to the next.  This lesson should be spread over more than one day to enable the students to benefit from experimenting with the materials and sharing their ideas.\n\nClosure\n\nWhen all students have visited each of the stations, have each group demonstrate one of the exciting new discoveries they made as they investigated static electricity.\nInvite another group of students to visit the classroom and have your students show them the discoveries they made about static electricity.\nUse the transparency (page 20) to review the lesson.\n\n\nParticles and Electric Fields\r\nNormally, an atom has an equal number of electrons and protons, and so it is electrically neutral.  If an atom gains some electrons, it becomes negatively charged.  If an atom loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged.  Atoms that have an electric charge--either positive or negative--are called ions.\r\nEvery particle is surrounded by an electric field.  Charged particles exert a force on one another, even when not touching, because each electric field extends into the space around each particle.\r\nUncharged Particles\r\nIf two balloons are uncharged, they do not exert any force between them.\r\nParticles with Unlike Charges\r\nIf one balloon is charged positively and the other negatively, their electric fields interact and pull them together.\r\nParticles with Like Charges\r\nIf two balloons are each negatively (or each positively) charged, their electric fields interact and cause them to move apart.",

Use white crayon to trace the arc and pencil to make the small marks.  These represent the positions of the moon during half the month.\n\nPre-activity (Begin this lesson two days after the new moon.  Check the weather section of the newspaper or a calendar for this date.)\n\nDistribute the parent letter and Student Moon Record.  Discuss these with the students so they understand how to record the phases of the moon every evening at the same time.\nShow them the Classroom Moon Record and say that each day you will place a moon shape there showing what they report in the evening sky.  Point out where the sun is shown on the record.\nAs students report the moon shape each day, cut an adhesive dot into that shape and place it on the chart.  The first one will be on the first or second mark, depending upon how many days past the new phase this record is begun.\nAfter three days of recording data, have students predict how the next day's phase will look.  Draw all predictions on the board and check them the next day.  If a night is cloudy, have students predict what the shape of the moon was, based on the phases before and after.\n\nClosure\n\nReview the positions and phases of the moon relative to the sun's position.  Repeat the activity with the balls and light so students can see how this represents what they are recording.\nAbout two days after the moon is full, look for it in the morning sky in the west.  Its phase will change to gibbous, quarter, and then a crescent as it gets closer to the sun each day.  Be sure they see that it is now the left side of the moon which is illuminated by the sun.\n\n\nExtender\r\nMake a daytime record of moon phases after the full moon.  Project the moon record on blue paper and make the same markings.  Since this is a day view, the sun should appear in the east (sunrise).  Even though students will view the moon after the sun has risen, the sun can be in the east.  The full moon would be in the west as the sun is rising.  As the moon changes to gibbous, circles can be cut according to views seen and glued along the arc, continuing west to east, as the moon moves around Earth.  The last quarter phase would be 90° between the east and west; the final crescent would be very close to the sun as it rises in the east.",

        "Directions": "Description\r\nThis project is designed to let children practice interview and writing skills, plus allow new teachers, new families, substitutes, and others an interesting way to get to know the staff at our elementary school.  The students will be writing their own interview questions, developing a paragraph about their staff member, and then use the digital camera to take their picture.  They will enter all of this information onto a HyperStudio card and the teacher will then take all of the cards and make a stack to be shared with everyone.  It can also be turned into a slideshow for viewing on the school's entryway TV during conferences or any other special occasion.\nProcedure\r\nWhen new families, new teachers, and substitutes come into school buildings for the first time, they don't know anyone.  This lesson would be an interactive project that allows the students to inform others about who works at our school and what they do.  It helps them produce quality work because they are showing their work to someone other than themselves or their teacher, and they are responsible for organizing all of their material in order to have their HyperStudio card make sense.  It will also make them follow and stick to a time line.  They will need to be organized enough to stay on top of their job.\r\nThis project also focuses on technology, in that the children will display their knowledge through such a powerful medium.  They are always so excited about using the computers and without knowing it, will be learning the software while they enter all the information that they have gathered.  In order to get to this point, they will need to use some higher order thinking skills by setting up the interview, writing their own questions, sending out a reminder, conducting the interview, and from there, manipulating all the information that they have gathered from their interview to produce a quality writing piece about their staff member.  Discuss with students how this paragraph will need to be interesting and informative.  Work on how to make that happen during the whole writing process.  A project like this will also allow the children to spend time in engaging conversations with others.  After they interview their staff member, they will be evaluated by the staff member on their interview skills.  They will also be talking with their peers about their work and filling out a rubric to make sure they are on track.  This will allow the children to evaluate themselves and others.  It also gives them some insight on how effective communication can be when it is done correctly.\nPreparation\r\nIf you do this project at the beginning of the year, the children will need some extra time with directions, etc.  To introduce the project and discuss what good interviewing looks like and sounds like, watch videos of interviews and have class discussions about appropriate interview questions.  Notify the staff about this project so that they will know what to expect.  Have students begin writing their questions and sharing them with their \"peer editors.\"  Help students set up a time to interview their staff member and then conduct the interview.  This should take approximately a week from start to finish.  Give students the opportunity to finish their rough drafts and be ready to have them edited by their partner.   Editing should take one day and then they should be ready for the computers.  Prepare the interviewing and writing rubrics.  When the students have all saved their cards, you will need to put the final project together.  Connect the buttons to make the HyperStudio stack flow.\nStep-by-Step Teacher and Student Instructions\r\nThe students will be given a staff member to interview and a \"peer editor\" partner.  These will be set up by the teacher.\r\nThe students will be given the rubrics and will need to set up their interview time with their staff member.  This will all be discussed as a class before they make the arrangements.  After they set up their appointment, they will need to design an invitation reminder for their staff member.\r\nWhile they are waiting for their interview date to come, they will be working on their interview questions and discussing with their \"peer editor\" which are good questions and which need to be thrown out.\r\nDuring the interview, the children will need to get all of their questions answered and take a digital picture of their staff person.  They will also have their staff person fill out their rubric and have it returned to their teacher.\r\nAfter the interview the children will need to send a thank you to their staff member and then take all of their information and turn it into an informative, interesting paragraph.  This rough draft will need to follow the rubric and will be edited by their partner.  The teacher will look at it before the child goes to the computer.\r\nWhen the paragraph has been edited by their peer editor and their teacher, the child will be required to enter all of their information on to a HyperStudio“ card.  They will have to add a text box, add a button, and insert a picture on their card.  \r\nAll of the children will save their cards in one folder, so that it is easy for the teacher to connect the buttons and finish the project.  It can also be run as a slideshow if the teacher would like.\r\nThe children will be able to view the project and share it with the staff member they interviewed.  They will also be in charge of sharing it with new families, new teachers, and substitutes when they are in the building.\nAssessment\r\nThe students will be required to have the staff member they interview fill out the rubric about the interview and they will also evaluate themselves.  They will also have a rubric that will focus on their writing.  This will be filled out by the student, their peer editor, and the teacher.  This evaluation will be done after all of the students finish their project.\nExtensions\r\nThis project could be done as a movie and edited that way or it could be done with a digital video camera and made into an iMovie.  You could also interview people out in the community or any others that the children would find interesting.",

        "Objective": "Students will learn about Memorial Day and memorize the Gettysburg Address, a traditional highlight of Memorial Day programs.",
        "Directions": "Memorial Day is the day on which Americans honor those who have died for their country. It is celebrated on May 30th, or on the last Monday in May in order to make a three-day weekend. (On the calendar you may see \"Traditional Memorial Day\" on May 30th and \"Memorial Day Observed\" on the last Monday.) It is a legal holiday in most states. And, even though it falls in May, it is usually considered to be the mark of the beginning of summer.\r\nMemorial Day was originally called Decoration Day because it was the day women in the South chose to decorate the graves of men who had died in the Civil War. These women honored the dead of both armies, Union and Confederate. It is thought that Cassandra Oliver Moncure, a Virginia woman of French ancestry, started the movement.\r\nIn the northern states, the Grand Army of the Republic, which was an organization of veterans of the Union Army during the Civil War, was in charge of Memorial Day celebrations. The American Legion took over this responsibility after World War I. Today they sell small artificial red poppies around Memorial Day to raise money to help disabled veterans.\r\nMilitary parades are held on Memorial Day and special programs take place at Gettysburg and at Arlington National Cemetery. A highlight of these programs is often the reading of President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.\n\nMaking It Work\r\nAsk your students if any have gone to a cemetery to decorate a grave. Was it a military cemetery? Was it the grave of someone who died in a war? Allow students to share experiences.\r\nAsk students who come from different homelands to tell about ceremonies that honor the people who died in wars in the countries where they used to live. They may have first-hand experiences or they may wish to interview an older relative to get this information. Students may be interested in building an oral history of their family by tape-recording these interviews. (Make sure they get permission before recording an interview, even with a family member.)\r\nIf there are no representatives of other backgrounds in your classroom, have students do some research in the library to find out how other countries honor those who died in wars. Students can write reports or give oral reports to the class.\r\nRead Lincoln's Gettysburg Address to your students. Encourage them to memorize it. (See the activity sheet.)\n\nExtension Idea\r\nFind out about the American Legion and its use of red poppies. Often the American Legion holds competitions concerning patriotism, and poppies are a common theme. Find out if there is one such competition in your area.",

        "Directions": "Ask students about goals that they have set for themselves.  Did they ever want to give up because something happened that made their goals harder to achieve?  Tell them that this has happened to Olympians, too.  Discuss with them the following life stories.\r\nDutch athlete Fanny Blankers-Koen, age 22, was looking forward to the 1940 Olympic Games, sure she would win the gold as a sprinter.  But World War II came along, and both the 1940 and the 1944 Olympic Games were canceled.  She continued training, gave birth to a son and a daughter, and looked forward to the 1948 games.  By that time Fanny was 30, much older than the other sprinters.  She won  the 100-meter dash and the 80-meter hurdles, only to be mobbed by reporters who would not let her rest for her remaining events.  Yet she went on to win the 200-meter race and was a member of the winning 4 x 100-meter relay.  Fanny was the first woman ever to have won four track and field gold medals in the same Olympiad.\r\nIn 1938, Hungarian army sergeant Karoly Takacs was a member of his national pistol shooting team and expected to win in the 1940 Olympic Games, but a tragic accident happened.  While he was on maneuvers, a hand grenade exploded, leaving Karoly without his right hand, his shooting hand.  His hopes for gold dashed, Takacs was allowed to remain in the army, despite his disability.  He was severely depressed, but he began training again with a pistol, this time using his left hand.  At the 1948 Olympic Games, Captain Takacs stood on the winner's platform wearing his gold medal for pistol shooting.  He won it with his left hand, the hand he had never used for shooting prior to the accident ten years earlier.\r\nRay Ewry of Lafayette, Indiana, was paralyzed as a child and spent much of his childhood in a wheelchair.  Doctors believed that he would never walk again.  He devoted hours to exercise and not only walked, but developed great strength in his legs.  He won the three jumping events at Paris in 1900 at the age of 26, repeated his performance at St. Louis in 1904, and once again swept the jumping events at the 1908 Olympic Games in London.\r\nWhen Wilma Rudolph was four, she caught scarlet fever and pneumonia.  It was thought she would never walk again.  Yet, her mother drove her long distances to therapy, and her brothers and sisters spent many hours massaging her useless legs.  By age six, she was walking in special shoes.  But Wilma did not stop there.  In high school, she starred in basketball.  Switching to track, she made the Olympic Games team in 1956 and won two bronze medals.  In 1960, she returned from the Games with three gold medals.  She was a winner personally, too, being one of the most popular athletes of all time.\r\nLike most boys growing up in Flint, Michigan, trying out for Little League was an important part of life for young Jim Abbott.  The fact that he did not have a right hand made no difference.  At an early age he had learned to pitch and bat lefthanded.  When catching a ball in the field, he wore the glove on his left hand, quickly switching it to his right as he threw the runners out.  At the University of Michigan, Jim pitched his way to many honors, including the Big Ten Player of the Year.  As a member of the 1988 Olympic Games team, he made two appearances on the mound.  In the final game against Japan, he pitched a complete game to clinch the gold medal for the USA.  He was no longer thought of as a player with one hand.  Although Jim had reached his lifetime goal of earning an Olympic Games gold medal, he continued his athletic career by pitching in professional Major League Baseball.\r\nDistribute the activity sheets to students.",

        "Directions": "In the Past\r\nSalt Lake City was founded in 1847 by Brigham Young and many of his Mormon followers.  In the mid-1800s the city became a supply depot for the pioneers who were traveling to California.  The area also had a strong mining industry and later developed railroads that helped the city to become a business hub in the West.\nSalt Lake City Today\r\nSalt Lake City (located in the western United States) is the largest city in Utah.  According to the 1990 census, its population was 159,936.  The city is located in a valley surrounded by the Wasatch and Oquirrh mountains.\r\nSalt Lake City is the world headquarters of the Mormon church (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints).  The Mormon Temple and the Mormon Tabernacle are located in the center of the city.\r\nThe University of Utah and Westminster College are located in Salt Lake City.  It is also the home of many cultural groups, such as the Utah Symphony Orchestra, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and several ballet and opera companies.\r\nSalt Lake residents have a variety of sports teams to follow, including the Utah Grizzlies (hockey), the Utah Jazz (NBA), the Utah Blitzz (soccer), and the Utah Starzz (WNBA).\r\nOutdoor activities are also extremely popular in the area.  Within 50 miles, there are four ski resorts, including Solitude, Brighton, Snowbird, and Alta.  These areas are frequented in the summer months as well for hiking, mountain biking, and rock climbing.\nActivities\n\nHave your students research Salt Lake City's past, searching for information about the city's agricultural and mining industries, as well as the supply depot that was so valuable to the westward traveling pioneers in the 1800s.\nAllow each student to select an area of interest concerning Salt Lake's modern-day entertainment activities.  A student may want to research snow skiing in the area, the cultural events, or a popular sports team from Utah.\nDuplicate and distribute copies of the Utah map on page 21.

        "Objective": "Students will create an artistic representation of the Navajo ideal of hozho.",
        "Directions": "Culture Clues\r\nThe Navajo have many rituals and ceremonies.  Most of them are related to the Navajo concept of hozho.  This single word has a very complex meaning.  It conveys ideas about beauty, goodness, happiness, and harmony.  It is a summary of the highest value and final goal of the Navajo people.  \r\nThe world is full of good things, but there are also many bad things.  A person might be contaminated by one of these evil elements.  The purpose of the Navajo rituals is to help the individual overcome bad influences and restore hozho.  These ceremonies are called Chantways.  If the Chantway ritual, which could last up to nine days, was correctly performed.  The Navajo believed that the Holy People would notice and take action to cure the patient.\r\nThe rituals called Blessingway were not to restore hozho but to promote it.  Different occasions, like protecting the herds of sheep or a new marriage, had Blessingway ceremonies.  The ritual began at sundown and continued uninterrupted for two nights and one day.\r\nIn some rituals a dry painting or sand painting was made from dried pigments.  The materials were shaped into patterns on the floor of the patient's hogan.  The size ranged from less than 1 foot (31 cm) to 20 feet (6 m) in diameter.  It took many hours to create each sand painting.  At the end of the ritual, what remained of the painting was destroyed.  The Navajo believed that the reason for the painting's existence had ended.\nActivity\nDraw an original design on the poster board.  Look at pictures of Navajo designs for ideas about how the picture should look.  Sample designs are provided on the activity page.\nUse crayons to lightly color the design.  The Navajo traditionally used black, red, white, and yellow for their sand paintings.  \nApply white glue to all areas that will be a particular color.  Sprinkle that color of sand generously over the glue.  \nWhen the glue is dry, shake off the excess sand.\nContinue until you have used all the colors.\nOn a piece of paper, write about your design.  What is the purpose of your painting?  How does it reflect the Navajo ideal of hozho?\n",

        "Objective": "Students learn about women in history who worked to abolish slavery.  They learn about the importance of goals and ambitions.",
        "Directions": "This activity can be done as part of a Women's History Month unit, or as a standalone activity.\r\nBegin by introducing students to the Grimke sisters.  Ask them, if they knew that in the early history of the United States many African Americans were kidnapped and brought to be sold as personal slaves of wealthy landowners in the United States,  These people had very few rights and were often used and abused by their owners.  Their struggle for freedom was aided by two very unlikely women in the early 1830s.\r\nAngelina and Sarah Grimke grew up in a wealthy South Carolina family who owned land and slaves.  Instead of taking the slaves for granted, they viewed them as equal playmates and friends.  Sarah even taught many how to read and write. She could not bear to see them physically punished or abused and spoke out against it whenever she could. \r\nAs the two sisters grew older, they knew that they had to do something to stop the abuse of slaves.  Women during those days could not vote or speak in public in many towns along the Eastern seaboard.  Their task would be a difficult one.  They risked everything, including their lives, to travel north to launch a campaign to educate people about the injustice of slavery.\r\nOn one occasion Angelina addressed a group of men and women gathered in Boston before a State Legislative Committee.  Her topic was \"Abolition,\" the elimination of slavery.  People became so angry at her words about equality and the dignity of every human being that they burned down the building in which she gave her speech.\r\nA few years later, Sarah, frustrated with the violent discrimination her sister had experienced when she spoke against slavery, wrote a book advocating equality for women.  Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Other Essays argued for equal rights for women under the law.  Without her landmark effort perhaps it would have taken even many more years for women to gain the right to vote that they finally won in 1920.  Both of these women were early pioneers in social reform that continues in our country today.\nSuggested Activities\n\nDiscussion Questions\r\n    \nKnowledge: What did Angelina and Sarah do to inform people about the injustices of slavery?\nComprehension: Was slavery abolished because of the efforts of these two sisters?\nCreative Thinking: While slavery was outlawed during the the Civil War, some people claim that they are still treated like slaves.  Can society or another person enslave others today?\nApplication: How can you stop discrimination?\nAnalysis: Can people today do anything to help others succeed when they are treated unfairly because of their sex or race?\nSynthesis: Why did this biographical sketch deal with both sex and race?\nEvaluation: Have you ever experienced discrimination?  How did you feel?  Were the Grimke sisters justified in breaking laws in order to help others?\nAffective: Would you risk everything in your life so that someone else might gain something? Would you dedicate your life to helping others?  Why?\n\n\nSkills Focus\r\n    \nLanguage and Communication Skills: Write two sentences describing why all people in the United States should be equal.\nIndependent Study Skills: Are there others who have worked for equality in your lifetime?  Go to the library and investigate terms such as \"Equal Rights,\" \"Voting Rights Acts,\" \"Title Nine,\" and \"Civil Rights Legislation.\"\nManipulative Skills: Write and illustrate a story to read aloud to a younger student in your school.  Read the story to the student.  Then help the student read the story you have written.\nJournalism - Advertising\r\n        \nCome One, Come All!:  Prepare a poster inviting the community to go to hear a lecture by the Grimke sisters about the opposition of slavery.  Be sure to give the time and place.  How would you make the reader want to go to the speech through the poster alone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nDistribute the Goals and Ambitions activity sheet to students and have them consider their own goals and ambitions for the future.",

        "Objective": "Students learn about the origins of last names in Medieval times.",
        "Directions": "Introduce to students \"The Story of Last Names.\"\r\nA long time ago, four men named Thomas lived in a little town.  That was the only name any of them had.  In those days, only kings and nobles had last names; most men and women had only first names.\r\nBecause the men had the same name, here's how people told them apart.  One Thomas had a father named John, so he was called \"Thomas, John's son.\"  Another Thomas, a baker, was called \"Thomas the Baker.\"  The third Thomas had light-colored hair, so he was known as \"Thomas the White.\"  And the fourth Thomas lived next to the village green, so he was known to everyone as \"Thomas of the Green.\"\r\nTime went on.  Thomas the Baker married a girl named Elaine.  She became known as \"Elaine, Thomas the Baker's wife.\"  They had a little boy named John, and he was known as \"John, Thomas the Baker's son.\"  But after a while, people got tired of saying all those words.  So they simply called Thomas the Baker, \"Thomas Baker.\"  His wife became Elaine Baker, and their son was John Baker.\r\nThat's how last names came to be.  People took their fathers' first names, the names of their fathers' jobs, the names of the places where they lived, or names that told how they looked.  They put these names after their first names.  When a man married, his wife and children took his last name.  Sometimes, a widow or single woman might adopt children and give them her last name.  So, today, our last names can tell us something about the people we got them from long ago.\r\nAsk students to pay close attention to see if their last names are on one of the following lists.

        "Directions": "Race Car Driver and Physicist\r\nWhy would a well-educated young woman choose a career as a mechanic and race car driver?  Janet Guthrie's family and friends would never understand why a woman who had a wonderful job as a physicist in the aerospace department of Republic Aviation would want to throw away her life on racing cars.\r\nJanet's love for adventure led her to the racing world.  She sold everything she owned, including her XK-120 Jaguar.  Her goal was to build her own race car from scratch.  She bought a brand new Toyota and promptly tore it down.  It took her a year to rebuild it so that it would be able to compete.  Since she had no steady job, life was a struggle.  She had to abandon her apartment for a single room in the back of a store.  Only odd jobs kept her alive and paid for the parts she needed for her car.  Finally, worn out and virtually penniless, Janet took a job as a technical editor for Sperry Rand.\r\nAlthough she could find no racing sponsor, she did not give up.  She kept making appointments and attempting to sell the world on the idea of a female race car driver, but sponsors thought a woman was too much of a risk.  Finally, someone took a chance and asked her to race.  She finished that race and continued to win in club races and some professional ones.  At last Janet set her sights on a race that would test her endurance: the Indianapolis 500.\r\nIn 1976 Janet attempted to qualify for the Indy 500, but car problems eliminated her.  But that same year she did become the first woman to race for the National Association for Stock Car Auto Races.  In 1977 she became the first woman to race in the Indy 500; the following year she placed ninth in her Texaco-sponsored #51 racer at Indianapolis.\r\nJanet Guthrie is a pioneer.  The thrill of racing caused her to decide that a life driving off into the sunset was better than sitting at a desk.  Her spirit of adventure paid off not only for her but also for every other woman whose career leads her to the speedway.\nSuggested Activities\n\nKnowledge: What kinds of jobs did Janet do before and while she worked toward becoming a race car driver?\nCreative Thinking: If you wanted to become a race car driver, how would you find someone to sponsor you?\nApplication: Draw your conception of the fastest race car of the future.\nAnalysis: Why was it so difficult for Janet to find a sponsor and become a professional race car driver?\nSynthesis: Did Janet's experiences before her professional career as race car driver help her in any way?\nEvaluation: Do you think that Janet was happy with her life as a race car driver?\nAffective: Do you think that racing cars is hazardous?  Do you think it is more hazardous for women than for men?\n\n\r\n        Distribute the activity sheet to students and have them complete the activity.\n",

        "Directions": "Once upon a time. . . Fairy tales have been passed down for generations.  Discuss with students the elements and background of fairy tales.  Fairy Tales contain elements of magic and are stories of good versus evil.  Originally, fairy tales were passed on by women as a way to teach lessons to children about life and behavior.  Later, the tales were written down by people like the Grimm Brothers to share as entertainment and as a study of folklore. Authors like Hans Christian Andersen wrote new tales to share with people.\r\nAsk students to think of their favorite fairy tales.  Choose one to discuss with the class.  Ask students to describe the characters, who they are and how they act.  See if they can identify the lesson or moral of the fairy tale.  Lead the class into a discussion of how fairy tale lessons apply to society today.\r\nAlthough some of the lessons taught in fairy tales are still important, many of the lessons are no longer valued in modern society. For example, many fairy tales tell the story of a beautiful but helpless woman who needs to be rescued by magic, or by a man.  Today, women and girls are encouraged to be more independent. \r\nDiscuss with students the idea that although many fairy tales still contain valuable lessons, it is important to think about the messages in the tales and consider whether or not they are relevant in modern life.\r\nDistribute copies of the A Closer Look at a Fairy Tale activity page.  Tell them that they will read a version of the fairy tale (as a class or individually).  On the activity page, they identify the roles of the male and female characters as well as the messages and lessons they find in the story.  When the students have finished, have a class discussion about what was discovered.",

        "Directions": "Discuss with students the fact that the Plains Indians depended on the buffalo (bison) for their existence.  The buffalo provided clothing, food, robes, blankets, tools, rugs, fuel, and eating utensils.  The Plains Indians respected the buffalo and always gave thanks for the buffalo's assistance in their way of life.  \r\nOftentimes, stories would be recorded on buffalo skins.  These stories were written in symbols known as pictographs.  Distribute to students copies of the Buffalo Hide reference page, which has examples of a number of pictographs.  Explain to them that they will use these pictographs to tell their own stories.\r\nDirections for Creating the Buffalo Hides:\r\n1.  Cut along one seam of the paper bag to open the bag into a large piece of paper.\r\n2.  Using scissors or tearing (tearing looks more authentic), cut out a hide shape from the paper.\r\n3.  Using crayons and the pictograph samples from the Buffalo Hide reference page, write a story on the bag.  Be sure to press very hard on the bag with the crayons.\r\n4.  In a sink or bucket of water placed on a newspaper, dilute one cup (250 mL) of brown tempera paint.\r\n5.  Lightly crumple the paper buffalo skin and immerse it in the tempera mixture.\r\n6.  Knead the hide gently to remove excess water.\r\n7.  Carefully open up the hide and lay it flat on newspapers to dry thoroughly.",

        "Objective": "Students will learn about the Christmas customs in Great Britain.",
        "Directions": "Happy Christmas! is the traditional English Christmas greeting.  Many of the most popular Christmas customs in the world today come from Great Britain.  For example, the Christmas card originated in England, and some think that school children were the first to send them.  Away from home attending school, they would make and send beautiful cards informing their parents of their progress and hinting that gift-giving season was near.  The first Christmas card was printed in England in 1843, and its popularity grew.\r\n\"Wassailing\" is also a British custom.  Groups of people walk up and down the streets of their neighborhoods at Christmastime singing carols while sipping a hot punch-like drink.  The children in the group hope to receive treats while they sing.  Wassail means \"be in good health,\" and when a group of people drink wassail together, all quarreling is supposed to end.  Wassailing takes place most commonly during the twelve days of Christmas (between Christmas and January 6).  Traditionally, this whole period is a time of great revelry.\r\n\"Mumming\" is another English tradition.  People dress in costumes and masks to put on Christmas plays throughout the holiday season.  Sometimes Father Christmas joins in the festivities, too.\r\nBefore the English have their Christmas feast, they pull open Christmas \"crackers.\"  These are paper cylinders filled with small prizes and riddles.  They make a noisy cracking sound when opened.  Sometimes they include paper hats which are to be worn around the holiday dinner table.\r\nAfter dinner, the family goes to a sitting room to tell ghost stories or \"Christmas Tales.\"  The most famous tale is Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.  There may be a Yule log in the fireplace, although this is not as large as it was many years ago.  In many homes today, candles have replaced blazing fires to represent the Star of Bethlehem and the Light of the World.\r\nBoxing Day in England is on December 26.  In the past, people rewarded their good servants with gifts of money enclosed inside special boxes that were opened on the day after Christmas.  Today, this public holiday is still celebrated, but the \"Christmas boxes\" are given to community workers such as mail carriers.\nActivities\n\nGhostly Christmas stories were popular in England.  Share some of these with your students, and then ask them to write their own ghost stories with a Christmas theme.  Illustrate them and put them in the school library to be shared with other classes.  \nPractice the art of mumming.  Write a Christmas play and perform it for parents, using costumes and masks.\nMake pomander balls.  To do so, each child will need one whole orange, whole cloves, and ribbon or yarn.  Push whole cloves into the orange peel until the entire orange is \"studded.\"  Tie ribbon around the ball to make a sling and leave a length for hanging it.  Set it aside for several weeks to dry.  (Optional:  Place it inside a nylon bag to dry more evenly.)  Tighten the yarn hanger as necessary and hang in a room or closet for a wonderful scent.\nSome famous English Christmas carols are included with the activity sheets.  Learn the songs, and then ask the students how they reflect English Christmas traditions.\n\nMake Christmas Crackers\nOn a scraps of paper, have students write a riddle, joke, or lesson (moral) to be enclosed in the cracker.\nCut the construction paper into 7 in x 12 in (17.5 cm x 30 cm) pieces.\nRoll the cardboard tube in tissue paper.  Tape or glue if desired.\nWith yarn, tie a tight bow in one end and fan out the remaining paper.\nPlace the riddle and toys or candies inside the tube.\nUse yarn to tie up the other end.\nWhen the Christmas celebration begins, yank both ends to pull open the cylinders and discover the treats.\nMake Gift Boxes\nDuplicate the gift box pattern on a variety of colored paper.\nLet students choose a color they like and add decorations before putting it together.\nCut and fold the box according to the steps listed on the pattern page.\nAfter inserting a small gift item, tie the box closed with ribbon or yarn.",

They should have a separate card for each date on the time line with the date clearly written on each note card.  They need to write complete and thorough notes on each event.  Be sure they properly record the sources used on each note card.\r\nGive the class a time line for the project.  The students do their research and design the actual project format.  The project must include a title page, a bibliography, a table of contents, and eleven slides/scenes/cards (one for each year).  It must also include a graphic downloaded from the Internet, graphic imported from a clip art, at least two scanned graphics, text, an animated graphic, sound, and a digitized movie.  \r\nStudents should use the Group Project Guidelines (page 125) as a checklist while they complete the project.  The Self and Partner Evaluation (page 126) makes a nice assessment after the project is completed.\nExtension\r\nStudents can extend their research into areas that especially interest them.

In 1926, a scholar named Carter Woodson felt that African Americans did not know about the achievements of their collective past.  He instituted Negro History Week as a time to learn about and celebrate these past achievements.  In 1976, this celebration became a month-long one, and is seen as a time to reflect on achievements and contributions that may still be too little known. \r\nThis activity can be used as an introduction to the origins of African Americans, and as a study of the continent in the past and today.\r\nMake one set of country cards by cutting out the six cards and the six flags from the activity pages. Glue them back to back.\r\nDivide the class into six groups. Distribute one country card to each group and a map of Africa to each student. Give each group time to read the information on their card and research further information about the country. Have each student color the country on the map of Africa, write a paragraph about it, and draw pictures of its flag and main products.\r\nRegroup the class so that students with the same countries are in different groups. Have students take turns presenting their countries to the group. If necessary, let students check the country cards for extra information.\r\nExtension Ideas:\n\nHave each student make a full set of country cards.

They discuss with their parents the details of one of the stories that interests them and then they write a one-paragraph summary of the story of interest.  Allow time for the students to share their reports with the class.  Discuss, also, the manner in which the reporter communicated the story: What was her attitude? How was she dressed? Where did she stand? In which direction did she face? Did her face give away any hints as to how she felt about the story? etc.  Explain that each student will have a chance to gather the latest \"scoop\" off the Internet and report the news to the class in a professional manner like a real-life news reporter.\nTeaching the Lesson:\r\nAssign students news partners.  They will have the same partners throughout the school year.  Each week, have the class scan the headlines for interesting news items.  Set aside fifteen minutes for the students to share what's going on in the world that interests them and discuss the stories.  In addition, allow a different pair each week to go online to obtain a news story to share with \r\nthe class.\r\nEach pair needs a copy of page 132.  Write one of the following category links on the line entitled \"Today's news category.\"\n\n\n\n\n Current Events   \n Newswires   \n\n\n International   \n Television   \n\n\n Newspapers   \n Weather   \n\n\n News Magazines @   \n\n\n\n\n\r\n(If possible, assign seven pairs each week to link to each of the categories above.)  After clicking the link, students have a list of Web sites from which to choose.  They select a site that appeals to them, link to it, and then get the scoop!\r\nAllow the pairs about fifteen minutes of class time to organize their story and write a dialog for the class.  They may wish to conduct an interview, do an on-scene report, or simply report the news like an anchor at the station.\r\nCreate a television screen for the students to stand behind with paints and a piece of cardboard from the side of a large box.  The students give their news report, live and on television, on \r\nFriday mornings.\r\nAnother option is to videorecord the students giving their news stories and broadcast it on Friday's morning show if your school conducts one.

        "Directions": "Tiny Town Materials\r\nThere are several ways that Tiny Town can be constructed.  Use whatever works best for you.  Remember that valuable measuring and directional skills are involved in this process.  You will have to consider various factors, such as the following:  class size, student ability, and available adult help.\r\nThese factors will help you determine whether you want to have the children measure and cut the brown paper strips for the roads or have a teacher's assistant or parent volunteer do it ahead of time.  Prior to making the roads, you may want to show a video or movie on how roads are constructed. \r\nForm teams with four to six children on each team.  Carefully select children with different abilities to help contribute to the teamwork on each team.  For example, a child who is not strong academically could be the caretaker of the materials.  He or she would be responsible for having everything ready for the team to begin work.\nDirections\n\nHave each team fold the green paper exactly in half lengthwise and in half again in the other direction.\n\nHave students cut out the directional words (North, East, West, South) on page 11.  Reduce or enlarge signs as needed.  Have them decide the correct placement for each sign.  (Give them a hint: Each sign will be on one of the creases they just made.)  Point out that the four main directions spell out the word n-e-w-s.  Please be sure all four signs are at the edge of the paper to allow adequate space for Tiny Town.  When the four signs are correctly placed, the students may glue them on the paper.\nNext, use the brown butcher paper to design the streets.  The paper should be 1 yard wide and 1 yard, 30 inches long.  See page 12 for placement of the streets, driveways, and parking lots.  Each 'lane' is two inches wide.  Use a yellow pencil to make a dashed line exactly down the middle of each street (as real streets have).  If it is not exactly in the middle, the toy cars will be driven illegally on the yellow line.  Next, use a white pencil to make the edges to represent curbs. Then cut out the 'Street Signs' on page 11 and glue or tape them onto each street.\nGlue the streets to the green paper according to the Tiny Town Street Layout on page 13.\n",

        "Directions": "Facts to Know\r\nProbability is a term used in mathematics to explain the chance that a future event will occur, or the likelihood of an outcome.  Think to yourself.  What is the likelihood of you eating ice cream today?  Will it definitely happen?  Will it definitely not happen?  Will it perhaps happen?  Probability helps us assign a numerical value to the likelihood of future events or outcomes. Some events, such as the sun rising each day, are certain.  They have a probability of 100% or 1. Some events, such as a dog flying through the air, are impossible.  They have a probability of 0% or 0.\r\nSome events, such as catching a cold, may occur or may not occur.  Depending on a number of outside influences, this particular event may be likely or unlikely.  This likelihood may be assigned a number between 0% and 100% or between 0 and 1.  For example, if you are usually pretty healthy, and you have been eating right all winter and dressing appropriately when you go outside, you may think you only have about a 10% chance of catching a cold.  But if you have been around a lot of friends and family members who have had colds, or if you usually catch a cold every winter, you may think you have about an 80% chance of catching a cold.\r\nFor some events, which have only two outcomes, such as flipping a coin, the likelihood of either outcome is equally likely.  This means there is an equal chance that these events will occur or not occur.  They fall right in the middle and have a probability of 50%, .5, or 1/2.\r\nIn the case of the flipping coin, either heads or tails will appear.  The likelihood of each outcome is equal.\r\nSimilarity, if the forecast calls for a 50% chance of rain, the meteorologist is telling you that there is an equally likely chance of rain and no rain.",

        "Directions": "Tell students that when they are working on division problems, there are rules that they can utilize to make their problem solving easier.  These rules are based on patterns within the numbers.  Explain to students the following rules, writing the examples on the board as you go along.\r\nIf the divisor is 2, the rule is that a number is divisible by 2 if the last digit of the dividend (or ones digit) is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.  For example, 42 ÷ 2 = 21.\r\nIf the divisor is 3, the rule is that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of the digits in the dividend is divisible by 3.  For example, 126: 1 + 2 + 6 = 9; 9 is divisible by 3, so 126 is divisible by 3.\r\nIf the divisor is 4, the rule is that a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits of the dividend is divisible by four.  For example, 428: the last two digits are 28; 28 is divisible by 4, so 428 is divisible by 4.\r\nIf the divisor is 5, the rule is that a number is divisible by 5 if the last digit of the dividend is 0 or 5.  For example, 115 is divisible by 5 but 412 is not divisible by 5.\r\nIf the divisor is 6, the rule is that a number is divisible by 6 if the dividend is divisible by 2 and 3.  For example, 642: ones digit is even so it is divisible by 2, and the sum of the digits 6 + 4 + 2 = 12, which is divisible by 3, so 642 is divisible by 6.\r\nIf the divisor is 9, the rule is that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of the digits in the dividend is divisible by 9.  For example, 693: the sum of the digits 6 + 9 + 3 = 18; 18 is divisible by 9, so 693 is divisible by 9.  \r\nIf the divisor is 10, the rule is that a number is divisible by 10 if the last digit (or ones digit) is 0.  For example, 250: the last digit of the number is 0, so 250 is divisible by 10.",

Ask the groups to discuss the pros and cons of buying a new car and a used car.  Have each group create a chart that shows this information.\nAsk students to review the costs for purchasing and insuring different kinds of cars that are given on the Transportation Price List so they can decide whether they can afford to buy new or used cars for their families.\nOther forms of transportation, such as city buses, commuter trains, motorcycles, and bicycles, are not considered in this cost analysis but can be discussed with students.\nYou may wish to have students look through the automobile sales in the classified advertisements of the newspaper.  If they can find new or used car prices that are better than the approximate ones provided on the price list, allow them to use these values in their calculations.\nDiscuss the three groups of new cars shown on the Transportation Price List.  Have students give examples of economy, mid-price, and luxury cars.  Then talk about the conditions of used cars.  Ask volunteers to describe what they think fair, good, and excellent conditions mean.\nAsk students why they think automobile insurance is important.  Invite an automobile insurance agent to speak to your class.  Encourage students to ask the agent questions about what services the agency provides and what the different costs are for new and used cars.\nHave students record their car insurance costs on their Transportation Summary forms.\nStudents should decide whether they will make monthly payments or pay for their cars in full, using money in their savings or checking accounts.  If students purchase their cars, they will not have any monthly car payments.  Therefore, the value recorded on their Transportation Summaries will be zero.  Point out that they will still have to pay for car insurance and gasoline.\nWrite the following gas prices on the chalkboard or have students determine what the price of each grade of gas is in your community and write that information on the chalkboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n Gas Prices   \n\n\n $1.14 per gallon (3.79 liters) of regular unleaded   \n\n\n $1.20 per gallon (3.79 liters) of mid-grade unleaded   \n\n\n $1.35 per gallon (3.79 liters) of premium unleaded   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell students to calculate the amount of money they spend on gas if they use 18 gallons per week.  After students have calculated the weekly cost of gasoline, have them multiply that value by four to get the monthly cost.  Remind them to record the monthly value on their Transportation Summary forms.\nHave students calculate the cost, insurance, and gasoline for a second car if their families need vehicles for their spouses.\nEncourage students to draw pictures of their family cars.\nAs an alternative to drawing pictures, you may wish to have students make collages, using car pictures from newspapers and magazines.\nRemind each student to write the total estimated transportation expenses on his or her Family Profile Recording Sheet (page 10).  Be sure students write monthly and yearly estimates.  Point out that yearly estimates can be obtained by multiplying the monthly estimates by 12.\n\nFollow-Up Activities\n\nIf possible, arrange to take students to a car manufacturing plant.  As an alternative, you could arrange a field trip to an automotive repair or body shop.\nHave students do research to learn about vehicles that run on alternative fuel sources such as natural gas, electricity, solar power, human power, and hydrogen.\nYou may wish to have students investigate to learn what the different advantages and disadvantages of purchasing and leasing automobiles might be.\nObtain automobile accident report forms from an insurance company and the local police department.  Reproduce these forms.  Give students the experience of filling out these forms.\nArrange to take students to traffic court.  Tell them to take notes during the hearings.  Discuss students' observations of the process.  Ask them what they think works well and what they think can be done to make improvements.\nHave students do research to determine how gas is obtained, how it is processed, how it gets to the pumps, and how the price is established.\nProvide students with outline maps of the world on which they can write.  Have them do research to learn where the world's largest oil deposits are found.  Ask them to color and label these locations on their maps.\nHave students keep a log of how much gas their real-life family uses and how many miles they travel using that amount of gas.  Show students how to calculate how many miles per gallon a car gets.  Ask them to figure out how many miles per gallon their cars get.  If a student does not have a car, tell him/her to use a classmate's log to do the calculations.  Then allow the class to work together to rank students' cars in order from best gas mileage to worst gas mileage.\nMake a class graph that shows what kinds of vehicles each student's family owns.  These can be divided into groups by vehicle models such as pickup trucks, motorcycles, two-door cars, four-door sedans, station wagons, sport utility vehicles, and sports cars, or they can be classified by the names of vehicle makers.\nEncourage students to design the cars of their dreams.  Allow them to use their imaginations to draw diagrams for any kinds of cars they think they would like to drive.  Students may enjoy making models of their dream cars.  Invite volunteers to share their diagrams or models.\n",

        "Objective": "Students review fundamental concepts of time such as A.M. and P.M. and learn about elapsed time.",
        "Directions": "Introduce the activity to students.  Use different types of clocks as examples.\r\nTell students that you are going to review some of the basics of how to tell time.  The short hand on the clock indicates the hour while the long hand indicates the minutes.  Not only do the numbers on the face of the clock indicate what hour it is but they also indicate the number of minutes in each hour.  Starting at the 12, you have to count by 5's, going around the clock until you again reach the 12.  Keep in mind that an hour is made up of four quarters.  Each quarter is 15 minutes long.  When the time is 15 minutes past the hour, it can be read as quarter past the hour (Example:  2:15 is also a quarter past 2).  When the time is 15 minutes before the next hour, the time can be read as quarter 'til the hour (Example:  2:45 or quarter 'til 3).\r\nTo keep track of the minutes and hours during the day and night, we use several devices.  A wristwatch with a second hand counts oscillations in a little wheel that rocks back and forth.  A grandfather clock counts swings of the pendulum.  A digital watch counts electronic oscillations in a quartz crystal.  All of these are fairly accurate, but they all must be adjusted once in a while.\r\nOne of the most accurate clocks is the digital clock which plugs into a wall socket.  Digital clocks count cycles of 60-cycle electrical power.  You might think that the power company is not in the time business, but it is!\r\nElapsed Time\r\nYou can calculate how much time has passed or elapsed from the beginning of an activity to its end.\r\nSample\r\nMonica and Eli went to the beach.  They left their house at 9:30 a.m.  If they got home at 3:00 p.m., how much time elapsed?\r\nFrom 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., 21/2 hours elapsed.\r\nFrom 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., 3 hours elapsed.\r\nAdd 21/2 hours to 3 hours.  So 51/2 hours elapsed from the time Monica and Eli left their house to when they came back home.\r\nUse the time conversion table below to help you work out the problems on the pages in this unit.\n\n\n\n\nTime Table\n\n\n\r\n            60 seconds = 1 minute\n\n\r\n            7 days = 1 week\n\n\n\n\r\n            60 minutes = 1 hour\n\n\r\n            52 weeks = 1 year\n\n\n\n\r\n            24 hours = 1 day\n\n\r\n            10 years = 1 decade\n\n\n\n\r\n            a.m. is the time from midnight to noon.\n\n\r\n            10 decades = 1 century\n\n\n\n\r\n            p.m. is the time from noon to midnight.\n\n\r\n            10 centuries = 1 millennium\n\n\n\n",

        "Directions": "Facts to Know\r\nTo solve some problems, you may need to undo the key actions in the problem.  This strategy is called working backwards.  But before you start these problems, keep in mind that you need to ask yourself these four important questions:\n\nWhat does the problem ask you to find?\nWhat information is needed to solve the problem? \nHow can you show the problem with numbers? \nWhat is your answer? \n\n\n Sample A\r\nThe bakers at Slice o' Pie Restaurant ate 4 pies that were left over from work on Thursday night.  12 pies were sold at the restaurant that night.  The manager took 2 home with her after work.  How many pies were at the restaurant Thursday night?\r\nFirst, find out the total number of pies sold or taken home.\r\n12 pies sold + 2 pies taken home = 14 pies\r\nNext, add back the 4 pies that the bakers ate.\r\n14 pies sold or taken home + 4 pies eaten by the bakers = 18 pies\r\nTherefore, there were 18 pies at Slice o' Pie Restaurant Thursday night.\n Sample B\r\nMarta likes to borrow books from the library.  She borrowed 18 books over a 3-month period of time (January-March).  If Marta borrowed 8 books in January and 6 books in February, how many books did she borrow in March?\r\nSubtract the number of books Marta borrowed in January and February from the total number of books to determine how many she borrowed in March.\r\n18 books - 8 books - 6 books = 4 books\r\nMarta borrowed 4 books in March.\r\nDistribute the activity sheets and have students use what they have learned to solve the problems.",

Have them answer the questions on the activity sheet.\r\nWhen they have finished answering the questions, give them the explanation for why the ice cream did not melt.\r\nThe meringue acts as an insulator, just like insulation in a house or coat.  The meringue has small air spaces trapped in it which slow down the passage of heat and cold.  Beating the eggs makes lots of bubbles in the meringue.  When you spread it over ice cream, it insulates so that the heat of the oven cannot get in during the short time it is in the oven.\r\nTell students that if meringue was permanent and did not melt, you could probably use it to insulate your house.

        "Directions": "Background\r\nA feature of some herpetiles' skin is its ability to change color.  Skin cells called chromatophores contain pigments and are responsible for the color change.  Changes occur from fear, but also from fluctuations in the amount of light present, humidity, and air temperature.  Warmer temperatures cause the chromatophore pigments to contract, which makes the dark-colored pigments harder to see.  Therefore, the herpetile's skin becomes lighter.  With cooler temperatures, the chromatophores usually spread out allowing more of the dark coloring to show.  This causes the skin to appear darker.  A few herpetiles can become a different color altogether.  Two of these species are the Anole and the Chameleon.  To view this amazing chromatophore phenomenon, follow the directions below.\n\nColor Box A's Anole light green and its background dark green.  Color Box B's Anole light brown and its background dark brown.\nCut away Box A and Box B.  (Note: You will now have three sections: A, B, and C.)\nFold Box C on its dashed lines using an accordion-style-folding pattern; crease the fold lines.  Re-open the folds and lay Box C as flat as possible on a desk or tabletop.\nCarefully cut apart Box A along the dotted lines.  (Note: Be sure you keep the nine cut strips in their correct sequential order.)  From left to right, glue the green strips onto the Number 1-striped sections of the Box C accordion folds.\nCarefully cut apart Box B along the dotted lines.  (Note: Be sure you keep the nine cut strips in their correct sequential order.)  From left to right, glue the brown strips onto the Number 2-striped sections of the Box C accordion folds.\nAfter allowing the glue to dry, re-fold the accordion pleats.  Unfold pleats slightly and place the Box C section in an up-right position.  When viewing the folds from a left-side angle, a green Anole will be seen.  When viewing the folds at eye level from a right-side angle, the Anole's chromatophores will have changed to brown.\n",

Most geckos do not have moveable eyelids.  Their eyes are always open.  A transparent scale called a spectacle protects each eye.  Can students think of ways that having their eyes open all the time helps geckos to survive?\r\nSnakes' pupils are round and vertical-elliptic.  They have no eyelids.  They also have spectacles.  The pupil shape of a snake's eye is not an indication of the presence of poison.\r\nMost frog families have horizontal-elliptic pupils, the exception being the Burrowing and Spadefoot toad families, which have vertical-elliptic pupils.  The bottom eyelids of frogs   move upward and cover the entire pupil area.  Can students think of reasons for this?\r\nCrocodilians have vertical-elliptic pupils with three moveable eyelids per eye: a semi-transparent lid, the upper lid, and the lower lid.  Ask students if they can think of ways that having these types of eyelids helps a crocodilian to find its prey. \r\nTell students that they will be completing a simulation to show an example of crocodile eyes.

Place the hot plate on the table and arrange seating for the students around the table at a safe distance.\nSet the hot plate on its lowest setting and turn it on to preheat it.\n\n\nActivity\n\nReview what the students observed as they watched their ice cubes melt in the previous activity.  Ask them to tell you why their ice melted.  (The ice melted because it was too warm.)  Ask them what they think will happen if you pour the water from their melted ice cubes into the glass container and then set it on the hot plate.\nGive each student a cup of water and let him or her pour it into the glass container.  Add a drop of dark food coloring to make the water visible.  Have the students notice where the water level is on the container.  Use the marker and place the #1 next to the marker at the top of the water level.  Number the other marks to the bottom of the container beginning with #2, etc.\nPut the thermometer into the water and have the students look at the level of the liquid in the thermometer.  Write the temperature on the board.  Continue to write the temperature on the board as the water heats up and begins to boil.\nPlace the container on the hot plate and turn up the heat.  Have the students observe what is happening.  Leave the thermometer in the water.  As they observe, ask them questions such as those below.\r\n    \nWhat do you see in the water? (Bubbles will begin to form as it gets hotter.)\nIs the water getting warmer?  How do you know? (The thermometer liquid is rising.)\nDo you see anything in the container other than water? (Steam will begin to appear.)\n\n\nAs the water begins to boil, point out that the bubbles are bigger and that the water is in motion.  Show the steam rising from the water.  Have students note the water level.  Ask them where they think the steam is coming from and where it is going.  (The steam is coming from the water, and it is going into the air.)\nContinue to record the temperature of the water (it should level off once it begins to boil), and point out the level of the water as it drops.  Stop the demonstration before the container boils dry.  Remove the container from the hot plate and place it on a pot holder on the table.\n\nClosure\n\nAsk the students what they think will happen to the rest of the water in the container.  (It will evaporate, turn to gas, and become part of the atmosphere.)\nDiscuss what they observed, being sure they understand that the water turned to gas when it was heated.\nDistribute the What Happened to the Water? Data Sheet for students to complete.  Permit them to discuss this with other students as they work on the data sheet.\n",

        "Directions": "Tell students that snakes have four main methods of locomotion:\r\nBig-bodied snakes, such as pythons, boas, and vipers, use a rectilinear motion.  They press their large scales against the ground creating traction and moving their bodies in a straightforward motion.\r\nSidewinder snakes, such as the Namib Adder, literally lift portions of their bodies off the ground and thrust forward in a sideways motion.  This form of movement keeps these snakes from falling down soft sand dunes and dusty trails.\r\nSnakes that move with a concertina motion literally bunch themselves up and thrust themselves forward by quickly straightening their bodies.\r\nSlender snakes, such as Rat snakes and Racers, move quickly by using a curving serpentine motion.  This is accomplished when the sides of their bodies push against surface irregularities moving them forward.  \r\nAfter introducing these methods, have students visually create the serpentine movement by following these directions:\nDirections\n\nUsing the scissors, cut apart the two Locomotion Illusion sections; discard the cut-away paper.\nGlue the straight-stripe section onto a piece of same-size cardstock; trim edges.\nChoose two to three colors to decorate the white stripes.  (Note: The illusion works best when there is a pattern to the colors.) \nCut a 1\" x 7\" (2.54 cm x 18 cm) pull-tab strip from the remaining cardstock.  Tape the 1\" \n(2.54 cm) pull-tab to the center back area of the striped section.  (Note: The pull-tab should extend beyond one of the two shorter sides of the striped section.)\nUsing the sharp knife or razor blade (ask an adult to do this), cut out the white, curvy lines on the black section.  (Be certain no white color remains after the lines have been cut out.)\nUsing the scissors, cut out a rectangle from the black construction paper that matches the curvy-lined box.  Place the colored-stripe, tabbed section on top of the cut-out black construction paper rectangle.\nPlace the curvy-lined box on top of the placed striped section.  Using the transparent tape, tape the top and side edges together.\nGently pull the tab downward to view the serpentine locomotion illusion.\n",

The following physical science activity will illustrate for your students Sir Isaac Newton's theory that \"for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"  In this case the \"action\" of the gases escaping the balloon will cause the \"reaction\" of the rocket moving forward.\nStudent Procedure:\n\nFeed the string through the straw.\nDetermine a flight pattern for the rocket.  There are a variety of options, all of which can be employed for comparative purposes.  Here are some suggestions:\r\n    \nTwo students hold the ends of the string in a level fashion. \nAttach one end of the string to the wall with tape or a pushpin.  (Be sure the string is level with the student.) \nAttach one end of the string to the ceiling. \nAttach each end of the string to the back of a chair.  (This option has been illustrated for you on the activity page.) \n\n\nAttach three pieces of tape to the straw.  Inflate the balloon, but just pinch it off instead of tying it.  While pinching the balloon, attach it to the straw and tape.  (See the diagram on the activity page.) \nMake predictions about the distance the balloon will travel.  Discuss whether the direction (up or across) will make any variation.  Record predictions. \nAt the starting signal, instruct the students to release the balloons and watch them fly across (or up) the strings.  (See the diagram on the activity page.) \n\r\nYou may wish to extend this activity by having your students add additional balloons (increased thrust) and weight (increased load) to the experiment and observe the results.  Also, try balloons of different shapes and sizes and observe and record any variations in speed and distance.\r\nFinally, ask your students to summarize the phenomenon of force that was used in this experiment.  Students should complete the data capture sheet in order to help them reconstruct and explain the experiment.  Through group discussions, encourage your students to come up with some universal principles that were used.",

        "Directions": "Fundamental Facts\r\nBlack bread mold has a fuzzy, spider-web appearance.  It is a type of parasitic fungi that lives on non-living organic matter.  It begins as a microscopic, airborne spore that germinates on contact with any moist surface of nonliving organic matter.  It spreads quickly, forming a fine network of filament clusters that obtain food by absorbing it directly from the organic matter it has attached itself to.  When the sporangia (knob-like spore cases) ripen, they break open, and the spores float in the wind until they land and begin the reproduction cycle again.  Fungi and bacteria can be found anywhere other life exists.  They work together to decay and decompose all organic matter.\nProcedure\r\nPrepare a bulletin board (away from bright light) to display the plastic bags.  It should be located in a place that is easily accessible for student observations.  If you do not have a board that is out of the direct light, staple a large piece of poster paper to the top of the board and let it hang loosely over the bags.  The paper can be lifted for observations.\r\nFind an open area outside, preferably out of the reach of animals, and roll out the foil.  Give each student a slice of bread.  Have the students place their bread slices on the foil and sprinkle them with a few drops of water.  Leave the bread out overnight.  The next day, have the students put each slice of bread in a plastic bag (be sure to label the bags with their names).  Tightly seal the bags and staple them to the bulletin board.  Make sure the students' names show.  Provide magnifying glasses for observations and the journal records for writing about their observations.\r\nAsk the students to hypothesize about the following questions:\n\nWhy was the bread dampened?\nWhy was the bread left outside overnight?\nWhy was the bread put into plastic bags?\nWhy was the bread placed in a darkened area?\nWhat will happen to the bread?\n\n\r\nHave the students complete the sequencing activity.

        "Objective": "Students read newspaper articles to determine the main idea of a story.",
        "Directions": "Finding Main Ideas\r\nWriters Communicate with Readers\r\nWriting is a form of communication.  Writers, in other words, have something to say to readers.  What the writer is talking about, the main point of what the writer is saying, is the main idea.\r\nWithout a main idea, nothing very much is said--nothing of importance, anyway.  Think of someone chattering endlessly without really telling you anything.  \"Get to the point!\" you say.  Or, \"What in the world are you talking about?\"  What you are asking for in such cases is the main idea of the conversation.  If there is no main idea there is no real conversation.  It is all small talk.\r\nIn good writing you shouldn't have to search for the main idea.  A good writer makes the ideas jump out at you.  Everything either points to the main ideas, leads up to them, or explains them. \n\r\nPreviews and Main Ideas\r\nOne reason that previewing is so useful is that it helps you find main ideas in your reading before you start to read.  A headline and sub-headings often tell at a glance what the main ideas are.  It isn't always that easy, but previewing  will certainly provide clues to main ideas so that you know them when you see them.\n\r\nMain Ideas and Details\r\nSome people have trouble deciding what is a main idea in a piece of reading and what is a detail about a main idea.  This should not be a big problem. Decide which sentence is the most important statement in a paragraph or in a group of paragraphs.  What is the writer talking about?\r\nDetails explain a main idea.  Details may be in the form of facts, explanations or descriptions.  What is the following short article about?  And what are some of the details?\n\r\nIt was a great day for the Clemson Tigers when they became college football's national champions.  The big win came in Clemson's victory over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.  This was the school's first national championship in 86 years of gridiron play.\n\r\nThis first sentence tells what the article is about.  The main reason for the article is to tell you about Clemson's big win.  So this is the main idea.  Where they won--the Orange Bowl, and what team they beat--Nebraska, are details.  The fact that this was their first championship in 86 years is also a detail.\r\nFind the main idea in this paragraph.\n\r\nThe town of Concord is where they fired the shot \"heard 'round the world.\"  But the people of Concord have become fed up with guns, handguns at least.  Concord has joined five other towns in an effort to ban ownership of pistols by private citizens.\n\r\nThis time the  main idea is not the first sentence.  The first sentence points to the main idea.  It starts you thinking about guns, which is the main point of the article.  Concord is fed up with guns.  That is the main idea and it appears in the second sentence which is also the topic sentence of the paragraph.\r\nThe last sentence tells what Concord is doing about handguns, so this is a detail.\n\n Putting Many Ideas Together\r\nThere is almost always more than one important idea in any reading material longer than a paragraph or two.  Long news articles and chapters of books are packed full of ideas.  But you can still point to one thing, the most important thing, that is the main subject of the whole article.\r\nWhat you want to do with long articles, or chapters of a book, is organize the ideas in your mind.  Here is how it is done:\n\nKeep the main subject of the reading in mind.  You may have found this in your previewing.  Write it down if you have to.

        "Objective": "Students learn about writing poetry and write their own free verse poems.",
        "Directions": "Discuss with students how to write a poem.  Introduce the following three-step method.  \r\n1.Choose a Subject \r\nJust about any subject or idea will work.  As you read more poetry, you will discover that poems have been written on just about every topic imaginable.  It's a good idea to choose a subject that is familiar to you.  Good subjects might be your pet, a family member, how you felt about an experience or event, a dream you had, or even what you see from the window of your room.  \r\nHere are a few ideas to get your imagination in gear:\r\nThink about a subject that is very important to you.  Maybe it's baseball, clean air, world peace, or new shoes.  If it's important to you, it will make a good poem because you will put energy and feeling into it.  Think of some subjects that are often overlooked, such as a far corner of the garage, an old toy, or even your elbow.  Things we don't pay much attention to often make good poem subjects.\r\nThink of an event in your life and write your feelings about it.  It could be a death in the family, a broken arm, a flight on an airplane, or visiting a faraway relative.  Remember your senses when you think of topics for poems.  You could write a poem about the sound of a dripping faucet at night, the smell of your dog coming in from the rain, or the sight of the sky after a storm.\r\n2.Prepare to Write  \r\nYou may want to let your idea \"incubate.\"  Incubation is a word many writers use for prewriting.  During this time, think about your topic, add to it and think of other things that are related to your topic and what it is that you want to say about it.  Ask yourself \"what if...\" questions such as \"What if my elbow got stuck?\", or \"What if I had three elbows on each arm?\", or \"What if my old teddy bear started to talk?  Would he tell me about everything I did as a baby?\"\r\n3.Write the Poem  \r\nOnce you have lots of ideas and notes, it's time to get your poem on paper.  Some poets write their poems just once and never change them.  This doesn't always happen, though, and when it does, the poet has probably spent a lot of time thinking about the poem ahead of time.  Usually poems are written just like anything else that is written.  There are scratch-outs, mess-ups, and changes made until it is finished.  Polish it as much as you can, avoiding imitation of another poet or person.  Some of the best things about poetry are that it is imperfect and individual.  You can structure your poem any way you want.  It can have stanzas, rhyme, or it can be free verse.  It's up to you.  But don't be surprised if your poem takes shape as you are writing it.\r\nIntroduce the idea of free verse poetry to students.  Distribute the Free Verse activity sheet and discuss the example poem on the page.  Then have students work independently to write their own free verse poems.",

Use the following question to guide your discussion:  \"Does this person feel sad, happy, outraged, supportive, excited, or amazed?\"\nInform the students that mood is the feeling that the audience has after reading the work of a particular author, listening to a song, or watching a movie. \nHave students read a story or listen to a song.  (Choose a song that has a narrative.)  When you have finished reading the story or listening to the song, lead a discussion about how the subject influenced the students' feelings and thoughts.  Use the following question to guide your discussion: \"Did you feel [sad, happy, outraged, supportive, excited, amazed, scared, or another emotion] as a result of reading the story or listening to the song?\"  Have students choose specific words, phrases, or sentences from the story or song that helped to influence their feelings.  Use the activity sheet entitled \"Identifying Mood\" to guide your discussion.\nDivide the students into pairs and have them read aloud the rough drafts of their reviews and identify the mood (if any) that they feel as a result of listening to their partner's drafts.\nInstruct students to each write a paragraph about the story they read or the song to which they listened.

Instruct partners to identify specific words and phrases in the paragraph that reveal the writer's feelings and thoughts about the subject.\n\r\nPortfolio Piece:  Have students include their paragraphs in their portfolios and each write a reflection on the importance of connecting with the thoughts and feelings of the audience. \r\nPublishing:  Have students write original survival stories.  Then have them share their survival stories in groups of four or five and identify the moods of the listeners as the authors share their stories.  (Possible feelings:  fear, concern, anxiety, frustration, etc.)\r\nTechnology Connection:  Create a bulletin board of reviews and categorize the reviews according to the feelings of the writers about the subjects being reviewed.\r\nHome-School Connection:  Have students look through magazines with a family member and focus on their moods when viewing the advertisements.",

        "Objective": "Students will write a three-paragraph essay about their favorite times.",
        "Directions": "Instructions\r\nThe following directions are broken down into parts to help students write a larger essay.  The main purpose is helping students to practice putting paragraphs together.  Plan to teach the following steps over the course of several days.  The number of days needed depends upon your students' ability, attention span, etc.\r\nIllustrating Directions\n\nBrainstorm with students their favorite days of the week and favorite times of the day.  Discuss the difference between a.m. and p.m.  Explain that a.m. is from 12:00 midnight until 11:59 in the morning while p.m. is from 12:00 noon until 11:59 in the evening.  Demonstrate the change of a.m. and p.m. on a manipulative clock.  If enough manipulative clocks are available, students may also manipulate their own clocks as they work in groups.\nInstruct students to fill in their favorite day and time in the a.m. and their favorite time in the p.m. on Worksheet #1. Students can write their favorite time in the a.m. on one clock and their favorite time of the p.m. on the other clock.\nDirect students to create an illustration of their favorite times by drawing a picture on their favorite day of the week.  Next to each hour of the clock, they can draw a symbol representing what they are doing at that time of the day.  For example, they can draw a bed at 1:00 a.m. and a plate of eggs and toast at 7:00 a.m.  When students are finished, they will have a 24-hour pictorial time line.  (The same symbol may be used for different times.)\nWriting a Three-Paragraph Essay\n\r\nFirst Paragraph\n\nDistribute copies of Worksheet #2 to guide students.  Explain to students that they will be writing about their favorite times in three different paragraphs to create one essay.  They can record their rough drafts on the worksheet.  The first paragraph will be about their favorite day of the week.\nThe topic sentence for this paragraph will state each student's favorite day; however, once the essay is completed, students will add a final, main topic sentence to the beginning of this paragraph. In other words, the first paragraph will probably have six sentences.  An example of the first paragraph topic sentence is as follows:\nMy favorite day of the week is Saturday.\n(Note:  An example of a main topic sentence that ties together all three paragraphs is given in Steps #9 and 10.)\n\r\nSecond Paragraph\n\nStudents then write three supporting sentences giving reasons why they have chosen their preferred day.  For example:\nI like Saturday because I do not have piano lessons.  Saturday T.V. also shows many cartoons.  I can play all day because I do not have to go to school \nThe students' concluding sentence for the paragraph might be the following:\nSaturday is the best day of the week.\nRemind students about the difference between a.m. and p.m.  Explain that a.m. is from 12:00 midnight until 11:59 in the morning, and p.m. is from 12:00 noon until 11:59 in the evening.\nDirect students to choose their favorite time of the morning and to write a paragraph using the same format as the first paragraph.  For example:\nMy favorite hour in the a.m. is 10:00.  Sometimes on Saturday, I watch television.  When I am at school, I go to recess.  On Sundays, I go to church.  In the morning, 10:00 a.m. is a relaxing time of day for me.\n\r\nThird Paragraph\n\nExplain to students that they will be writing about their favorite hour in the p.m. hours.\nDirect students to use the same format as the first and second paragraphs to write their third paragraphs.  For example:\nMy favorite p.m. hour is 6:00 p.m.  I like this time because my dad comes home from work.  I also get to play a little longer.  Then, I get to eat dinner.  In the evening, 6:00 p.m. is a fun time of day.\n\r\nMain Topic Sentence and Concluding Sentence\n\nExplain to students that they need to create one major sentence to begin their essays.  This is the main topic sentence that will begin the first paragraph and also will tell what the essay is about.  They are to write this sentence at the top of Worksheet #2 where it reads \"Main topic sentence of the essay.\"\nGuide students to read over their three paragraphs in order to create sentences that introduce their entire essays.  For example:\nI have many different favorite times.\nPoint out that they can not use \"My favorite day is . . .\" as a topic sentence because that only talks about one of the paragraphs.\nExplain to students that they now need to create one big concluding sentence---the final sentence of the third paragraph---that finishes the essay.  For example:\nIn closing, I enjoy each of these times very much.\nWhen students have completed their worksheets, students proofread the page for any errors they may have made and correct them.\nEdit each student's paragraph, or have students peer edit each other's work.\nOnce the editing step has been completed, instruct students to rewrite their essays on lined white paper with the proper heading (name, date, and subject) and a title.  Also, remind them to indent each new paragraph.\n\r\nVariations\r\nEmerging Writers\r\nWrite a single paragraph about one favorite time of the day.\r\nExperienced Writers\r\nWrite a three-paragraph essay independently, without a worksheet for guidance.  Include transitions, and develop complex sentences.\r\nEvaluation\r\nThe instructor will be able to check the following:\n\nIs there a main topic sentence and a main concluding sentence?\nAre there three complete paragraphs in the correct format?\nDoes the student provide supporting reasons for each favorite time?\nAre the grammar, punctuation and spelling correct?\nCan the student tell the difference between a.m. and p.m.?\n",

        "Objective": "Students match topic sentence cards to their correct body sentences cards.",
        "Directions": "Discuss with students the essential parts of a paragraph.\r\nThe Beginning\r\nThe first sentence of a paragraph is the topic sentence.  It tells what the paragraph will be about.  Topic sentences need a specific subject and a specific feeling or attitude.  For instance: \r\n\"My brother must be from another planet.\" \r\nMy brother is the subject; must be from another planet is the feeling or attitude. \r\nThe Middle\r\nThe sentences that follow the topic sentence add specific details to tell more about the topic.  The details need to make the topic more interesting or help explain what you mean.  Every sentence in the middle of the paragraph, or the body, needs to be about the topic stated in the topic sentence.  The sentences in the middle are also known as the body sentences or the supporting sentences.  Here are three body sentences for the topic sentence above:  \r\nFirst of all, he doesn't sit down and chew food like us earthlings; he inhales his food as he passes by the table, and then he disappears.  He has also been known to emit some very peculiar odors which he seems to like to collect and keep in the form of sweatsocks and dirty T-shirts which he tucks into corners of his room and under the bed.  If that is not enough, he makes very odd sounds that seem to be a kind of screeching language from his native planet, \"EEeeeeeecccchhhhsssss,  belllpppppp, gggggrrrrrroggggggghhhhh.\"\r\nThe End\r\nThe last sentence of your paragraph is the concluding sentence or closing.  This sentence reminds the reader of what the topic is about and what it means.  \r\nThis could be a closing sentence for the paragraph above:  \r\nAnd so, it is clear that my brother is not an earthling at all.  I wonder if my parents have figured this out?\r\nHere is a paragraph that has a topic sentence, two body sentences, and a closing sentence.\r\nSchool is fun.  In school we learn about many interesting subjects.  We read and write and play with our friends.  I can't wait to go to school each morning.\r\nTell students that it is their turn to think of body sentences to support the topic sentence.  Write the following examples on the board and have students fill in the blanks:\r\nSchool is fun.\r\n1. ______________________________________________________\r\n2. ______________________________________________________\r\nI can't wait to go to school each morning.\r\nExtension:  Instead of just two body sentences, have students think of three or four.  Write a paragraph that begins with: \"School is no fun at all,\" or \"My brother (sister/friend/pet) must be from another planet.\"\r\nDistribute the activity sheets and have students play the matching game to demonstrate their knowledge of paragraphs.",

        "Objective": "Students will learn about prepositional phrases and practice working with them.",
        "Directions": "Introduction\r\nA phrase is a group of words without a subject and predicate.  It functions as a single part of speech. A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition, a noun or pronoun that is its object, and any modifiers of the noun or pronoun.\r\nExamples:  Jon ate  at home.  Jon ate at the luxurious convalescent home.\r\nPrepositional phrases function as adjectives (to modify nouns and pronouns) and as adverbs (to modify verbs, adjectives, and adverbs).\nAdjectival prepositional phrases tell us more about or describe a noun or pronoun. They should be placed close to the noun or pronoun they modify.  Example:  The girl with long hair is coming to the party.\nAdverbial prepositional phrases do the work of an adverb. They tell us more about verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. They tell how, when, or where an action occurs.\r\nExamples:  The boy kicked the ball with a lot of skill. (modifies verb kicked);  Sally was rich as a queen. (modifies adjective rich);  I run early in the morning. (modifies adverb early)\nTeaching Strategies\nAdd a preposition\r\nHave children add a suitable preposition to begin a phrase.\r\nThe cow jumped _________ the moon.\nClassroom phrases\r\nHave children indicate the positions of certain objects in the classroom. Tell them that they must answer with a prepositional phrase.\r\nTeacher:  Tom, where is the television?\r\nTom:  near the table\nCircle the phrases\r\nAs children become more confident, have them search through sentences you have prepared, or through a photocopy of a familiar story, to find and circle the prepositional phrases.\nSuggest a phrase \r\nHave children suggest prepositional phrases used as adjectives (to describe nouns or pronouns) or adverbs (to describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs) to complete sentences.\r\nThe bell rings at nine o'clock. (adverbial phrase modifies the verb rings );  I saw the girl with red hair. (adjectival phrase modifies the noun girl )\nComplete the sentence\r\nProvide plenty of short exercises for which children must select the more suitable phrase to complete a sentence.\r\nThe boy swam (in the pool; on the roof).\nMake a sentence \r\nHave children make up sentences that include given prepositional phrases.\r\nbefore dawn   We left before dawn.\r\nacross the sky   A jet roared across the sky.\nOpposite match \r\nHave children match prepositional phrases with opposite meanings.\r\nat dawn   at sunset\r\ndown the steps   up the stairs\nAdd a phrase \r\nHave children add prepositional phrases of their own to make sentences more interesting.\r\nWe left the house.   We left the house before noon.\r\nThe girl fed the puppy.   The girl with red hair fed the puppy.\nWhere should the phrase go? \r\nMake up a number of sentences with the prepositional phrases incorrectly placed. Have children rewrite the sentences correctly.\r\nThe jet plane was piloted by a lady with four engines.  The jet plane with four engines was piloted by a lady.\nHow, when, or where? \r\nProvide children with a number of sentences with adverbial prepositional phrases.  Have them identify whether each tells how, when or where. \r\nwith a friendly smile (how); in the box (where); before nine o'clock (when)\r\nStudents can complete the activity sheets after you finish one or more of these activities with the class.",

        "Directions": "Ideas\r\nYou can give the students the two activity sheets using the book, Bobby Baseball.  The first gives them specific sections of the book that they have to re-write as Readers' Theater productions.  The second page gives them some more general instructions for writing Readers' Theater scripts about baseball or other childrens' books.\n\nStaging\r\nYour classroom is the stage.  Place four or five chairs or stools in a semicircle at the front of your class or in a separate staging area.  If you have no stools, have students sit on the tops of their desks, facing the audience.  Students may use simple costumes like hats or coats, but generally no costumes are used in this type of dramatization. \r\nIf you have plain robes or simple coats of the same color or style so that everyone looks about the same, this can have a nice effect.  Students dressed in the same school uniform or colors create an atmosphere of seriousness.  Props are not needed, but they may be used for additional details.\n\nScripting\r\nReaders' Theater can be done using a standard play format.  It is also easy to convert well-written dialogue from children's literature into a dramatic format. \r\nKeep the number of actors to four or five.  The most important reader with the largest amount of text is the narrator.  You can easily have the narrator role divided between two actors, if the text is long. \r\nIf you choose a children's book, such as Bobby Baseball, find a selection with a good deal of exciting or interesting dialogue.\n\nAssign the narrator to the sections without quotes. \nAssign separate actors to each role in the dialogue, such as Dad, Bobby, Mom, Jason, and Grandpa.  If there are too many roles, have one actor do two parts. (Make sure these two parts don't have to talk to each other.)\nDrop the inter-dialogue remarks such as he said, answered Dad, or remarked Jason. \nCopy the text so that each child has a clearly marked, useable script.\nPlace scripts in folders that are uniform in color and size.\nAllow children to practice for several days before presenting in front of the class. \n\n\nPerforming\r\nStudents should enter quietly and seriously into a dimly lit room, with their scripts held in the same position.  Actors should sit silently and unmoving on the stools or desks and wait with heads lowered or alternatively focusing on a point above the audience such as a clock.  The narrator should start reading and the actors will then focus on their scripts. The actors should focus on whoever is reading, except when they are performing.\n\nExtension\r\nEncourage students to add movement and memorization to performances after several experiences with Readers' Theater.  They can introduce mime to the performance and add props or costumes, as the circumstances allow.  Some students may begin to add accents as they become more familiar with the drama.",

These parts are called the root, the prefix, and the suffix.\r\nThe root word is the word from which other words are built.\r\nExample:  kind\r\nA prefix is a group of letters placed at the beginning of a word.  It changes the meaning or use of the root word.\r\nExample:  un + kind  =  unkind\r\nA suffix is a group of letters added to the end of a word. (Sometimes spelling changes have to be made.)

        "Objective": "Students write paragraphs with topic sentences that capture their reader's attention.  They create sentences from writing prompts and restate sentences as questions, commands, or exclamations.",
        "Directions": "A topic sentence states a paragraph's main idea.  It also serves to capture the reader's attention.  Most expository paragraphs begin with declarative sentences, but a writer can add variety by starting with a question, command, or interjection that expresses strong feelings or emotions.  This lesson is designed to give students practice in writing topic sentences that make main ideas clear and also appealing to their audience.\n\r\nProcedure:\r\nI.  Lesson Introduction\r\nA. Begin the lesson with a discussion about whales.  Talk about their size, where whales live, and how these creatures interact with humans.  Ask volunteers to create a declarative sentence, interrogative sentence, imperative sentence, and an exclamatory sentence using the topic \r\n\"killer whales\" (orcas).  Explain to the pupils that a topic sentence needs to be interesting and attention-getting.  Most expository writing begins with topic sentences that are declarative, or statements.  Sometimes a writer will add variety to a piece by beginning with a question, command, or interjection that expresses emotion.\r\nB. Direct the learners to read the paragraph about whales that goes with this lesson.  Have them locate and state the topic sentence.  Next, the pupils will brainstorm and attempt to restate that sentence in the form of a question, command, or exclamation.  A group of sample responses is provided.\r\nII.  Lesson Body\r\nA. Introduce the lesson practice worksheet.  The students will be given writing prompts and then asked to create a list of topic sentences.  Declarative statements will be acceptable for these exercises.  When these statements are given, the writers are asked to transform each into a question, command, or exclamation.  \r\nB. A review of the four types of sentences (declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory) and end punctuation may be necessary (page 41).  Remind the students that most expository writing begins with declarative sentences, but writers will occasionally vary their styles and use questions, commands, and exclamations to maintain interest and challenge their audiences.\r\nC. For reinforcement and reteaching, first gather together a collection of newspapers and periodicals.  Have the pupils identify a story of interest and then state its topic sentence.  After that, practice transforming these into questions, commands, and exclamations.  \r\nD. Extend the lesson by using these articles to practice summary writing skills.  Also practice writing conclusion sentences in the form of questions, commands, or exclamations.  This will provide a unique way to end compositions.\r\nIII.  Lesson Conclusion\r\nA. Close the lesson by having the pupils restate the purpose of a topic sentence.  They must also list different strategies that can be applied to make topic sentences more interesting and attractive to their audience.  Students will be asked to employ these techniques in future writing assignments.\r\nB. Writing Applications:  Whales like the orca, dolphin, and porpoise are often trained to entertain or assist humans with certain water-related tasks.  Instruct the students to write a paragraph about an animal that performs in a show or is trained to work with people for a common goal.  It may be an animal with which they have had personal experience or one observed at a circus, water park, or on television.  Tell them to begin by stating topic sentences in the form of questions, commands, or exclamations.\r\nC. Publishing Project: \r\n1. Group students together that have written about the same or similar animals.  Have them read their compositions to each other and then share their reactions and feelings within the small group.\r\n2. Computer Connection:  Many animal theme parks, zoos, and circuses have home pages listed on the Internet.  Allow the pupils to locate and view a few of these Web sites to help them research further information for their writing applications. \r\nIV.  Evaluation:\r\nA. Use the discussion questions and worksheets to measure student progress and skill mastery.\r\nB. Writing Applications:  Use the four-point rubric scale to determine if students can independently, can usually, or require assistance to write detailed descriptions of familiar, persons, places, objects, or experiences.",

        "Objective": "Given a thesaurus entry, the students will list and apply its synonyms to sentence writing.\r\nStudents will use a thesaurus to locate an entry's part of speech, definition, list of synonyms, and list of antonyms.",
        "Directions": "The intermediate level is the age at which the thesaurus must be introduced and utilized.  During the elementary years, dictionary skills are practiced and then applied.  Next, glossaries appear in the backs of reading, mathematics, science, and social studies textbooks, and students work with these references.  By fourth grade, pupils understand the concept of synonyms and antonyms.  A thesaurus becomes an important tool to help these youngsters increase and refine their writing and speaking vocabularies.  This lesson is designed to offer practice using a thesaurus.  Students will learn to add variety to their written compositions and eliminate repetitive language while revising.\r\nGoal:  \r\nStudents will use a thesaurus when revising and rewriting compositions.\r\nProcedure:\r\nI.  Lesson Introduction\r\nA.Prepare a list of synonyms for the word \"money\"  (e.g., dough, jack, simoleons, long green, bucks, cabbage, shekels, yellow boys, hard cash, bank, chicken feed).  Explain that our English language has a larger, richer vocabulary than most other languages.  A strategy to use in order to take advantage of our colorful language is to practice thesaurus skills.  A thesaurus is a book of synonyms and antonyms.  Writers look up common and overused words in a thesaurus in order to find synonyms.  These synonyms help make compositions more interesting and less repetitive.\r\nB.Inform the students that they are at an age where word choice is more crucial than it was during their elementary years.  Overused words must be identified and modified while revising and proofreading a paragraph.  Present the following list of words and have the pupils brainstorm a list of synonyms for each:\n\n\n\n 1.   \n good   \n 2.   \n nice   \n 3.   \n big   \n 4.   \n run   \n 5.   \n eat   \n\n\n\n\r\nNext allow time for the students to share their brainstormed lists.  Finally, let the students skim through a thesaurus to discover how this book is organized.  Instruct them to locate these entries and add more synonyms to their lists.\r\nII.  Lesson Body\r\nA.Introduce the lesson worksheet.  Point out that entries in most thesauruses are similar to those found in a dictionary.  Each word's part of speech, definition, and a sample sentence are present.  Unlike a dictionary or glossary, a thesaurus contains synonyms and antonyms for each entry.  Exercise A will help students familiarize and practice basic thesaurus research skills.\r\nB.Exercise B has students applying the entry's synonyms in context.  Pupils must study each sentence carefully and choose the best synonym from the given list.  By selecting the correct word, the sentence will be more exact and more descriptive.\r\nC.Exercise C asks students to look up a given word in an actual thesaurus and then use its synonyms to improve a list of sentences.  The goal is to get students to replace overused words with more interesting, higher-level synonyms.\r\nIII.  Lesson Conclusion\r\nA.Students are to state the purpose of a thesaurus and how it supplements a dictionary or glossary.  They are to list the basic elements of a quality thesaurus (entry words, part of speech, definition, sample sentences, lists of synonyms, lists of antonyms) and tell where to find this book on the reference shelf (in the same area as the dictionaries).\r\nB.Writing Applications:  Students are to locate in a thesaurus a common word that has at least five listed synonyms.  Next, they are to copy the entry, its part of speech, and synonym list.  Finally, the pupils are to create sample sentences for five of the synonyms.\r\nC.Publishing Project:\n\nThe teacher will collect the portfolio work and assemble it into a class thesaurus of commonly overused terms.  The class will refer to this booklet during the revision step of future writing assignments.\nComputer Connection:  Demonstrate the thesaurus option on the task bar of a word-processing program.  Encourage the writers to explore this function when creating future compositions and reports.\n\r\nIV.  Evaluation\r\nA.Use the discussion questions, practice exercises, and lesson worksheets to measure student progress and skill mastery.\r\nB.Writing Applications:  Use the four-point rubric scale to determine if students can independently, can usually, or require assistance to use the thesaurus to improve their vocabulary.",

        "Objective": "Students will observe an unexpected event and then write about what happened, including relevant details.",
        "Directions": "Preparation:\nOne day before the day you plan to conduct this simulation, play the old game of \"telephone\" with the students.  Whisper a message into the ear of the first student.  In turn, that student is to whisper what he or she heard to the next student, and so on until all the students have received a message.  The game works best when the message is a simple one such as, \"Mary went to answer the phone, but when she got there the phone was dead.\"  Vary the difficulty of the message with the level of the students in the class.  Whisper the message only once, and instruct the students to do the same.  When the last student has received a message, instruct the students to write down what they heard without saying anything until all have finished writing.  Then have the last student say aloud the message received.  Compare the messages each of the students heard.  Discuss how messages change when passed from one person to the next and how difficult it sometimes is to get an unexpected message straight.  \nSteps:\nThis part of the simulation should take place the day following the game of \"telephone,\" and requires the help of another adult and two students from outside the present class.  These persons should be ones you can rely on to keep a secret.  Tell them that you wish to prepare an activity for your class which will increase your students' abilities to observe and report, and you need them to be actors.\nGive the students and adult actors the script on the activity page (page 55).  Ask them to learn the script.  Plan ahead the day on which you are going to complete the simulation, but do not tell the students in your class that anything unusual is going to occur on that day.\nOn the day which has been planned, direct the actors to act out the script as printed.  The entire scene should take no more than two or three minutes to complete.\nWhen the actors leave the room, do not discuss with the students what has just happened.  Instead, distribute the questionnaire activity page (page 56) and direct them to answer the questions.\nCollect the papers which the students have completed.  Discuss their responses to the questions and how they might better observe and record another event for which they are unprepared.  Explain to them that often after an automobile accident or an altercation of some sort, different witnesses will give varying and sometimes contradictory accounts of what occurred.  When this happens, it can cause problems for police officers or other officials trying to discern what really occurred.\nFollow-Up:\nAn ability to observe and make accurate written reports is essential for many careers and professions.  Give the students several opportunities to observe and report in order to hone their abilities.  Some possibilities might include three-minute observations followed by written descriptions of the following:\r\n-- people going into and out of the school office\r\n-- people on the sidelines watching a game\r\n-- students at one table in the school cafeteria\r\n-- students waiting for the bus after school\nHave students write a description of a character, real or imagined.  Explain that one can tell what a person is like by the way that person looks, by what that person says, by what that person does, and by what other people say about that person.  Their characterizations should include a physical description and an example of that person doing something which shows that person's character or personality.",

Does it sound like a dream come true?  Before you get too excited and decide that this is the book report for you because it will be easy, give it some thought.  That is exactly what this book report will require: careful thought.  In this book report you will describe the setting of your story with a haiku and an illustration.  \n\r\nFirst, think about the setting of your book.  How do you see it?  Does it take place at a space station in the stars?  another planet?  Go back and look in your book for descriptions of the setting.  Write some notes and brainstorm.  List some of the items and what they look like.  One student listed for her setting: magnetized travel pods, large crystals, a desert-like planet, two suns, hot temperatures on the planet's surface, cool underground, gray concrete maze-like tunnels.\n\r\nNext, draw your setting.  Include as many things from your list as you can.\n\r\nNow write a haiku.  Haiku is a form of Japanese poetry.  It has three lines.  The first and last lines have just five syllables and no more.  The second line has seven syllables.  Haiku requires thought because each word is important in describing the mood or feeling of a scene or setting.  A haiku usually focuses on just one or two images that suggest a time of day, a season, a physical place, or what is special about something in nature.  The haiku writer focuses on the senses and what the setting means to him or her.  Here is a typical haiku:\n\r\nDolphins in the waves,\r\nSliding down the sloping sea;\r\nI join with my eyes.\r\nThe haiku is typical because it is about a setting in nature, and it indicates the writer's response.  Here are some haikus based on book settings:\r\nWinter light sparkles\r\nCoating all the prairie sod\r\nWith sparkling sprinkles\r\nSolid wood beneath\r\nSwirling winds torment above\r\nOnly safe right here\n\r\nThe first was written by a student who read one of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books.  The haiku describes a winter scene from one of the chapters.  Notice all the \"s\" sounds she used?  \n\r\nRepetitive use of a sound is a poetic tool known as alliteration.  The second haiku is by a student who read a book about some boys who survived a storm in a treehouse fort.  \n\r\nHere is the haiku written by the girl who brainstormed above (compare her brainstormed list with her haiku):\n\r\nCrystals, magnets zoom\r\nCool wind whooshing through gray tubes\r\nLeaving heat above.\r\nDistribute the activity sheets and have students write their own setting haikus.",

        "Directions": "Background for the Teacher\r\nPreparation: Reproduce the Sensational Colors worksheet and the Color Poem Response and Assessment Sheet.  Gather other materials needed for the lesson.\n\r\nLesson Plan\n\r\nPrewriting\n\nAsk students to close their eyes.  Call on one student and ask that student to describe what the color red looks like.  Most likely, the student will have difficulty and end up saying something like, \"Red is red.  I don't know!\"  The student might make comparisons to red objects, saying, \"Red is like strawberries or a fire engine.\"  Ask the student to further describe, saying \"I don't know what a strawberry looks like.  What do you mean?\"  You may need to assist by offering, \"Perhaps red on a strawberry is rough but sweet-tasting.\"\nHave students describe another color in the same manner, trying to avoid visual images and instead offering other sensory descriptions--texture, taste, sound, or smell.  If a student uses a visual comparison (\"Yellow is like the sun.\"), prompt the student to offer more information using other senses: \"Yellow is burning, bright, and hot.\"\nDistribute one crayon to each student.  Instruct students to sit with other students who have the same color of crayon.   This will be their writing group for the color poem.\n\nDrafting\n\nTell students that they will be writing a poem about a color.  They are to write the poem as if they were writing it for a person who has a visual handicap.  The person may not know what certain objects look like so they cannot write about things that are the color.  Instead, instruct students that they are to describe their color from each of the other senses: sound, smell, taste, and feel.\nRemind students that they will be using similes to compare their color to different sounds, smells, tastes, and textures.\nDistribute the Sensational Colors worksheet to each group of students.  Review the directions with them before completing the sheet.\nWhen groups have completed the brainstorming worksheet, share several sample color poems with them, either the four found at the bottom of this lesson plan or others found at the \"Have You Heard the Sound of . . . ?\" Web site.  Point out particularly effective word choices.  Elicit student feedback regarding the comparisons the authors used.  Note the structure of the poems for students.\nInstruct groups to review their ideas from the Sensational Colors worksheet and select those ideas which make the strongest comparison for each sense.  Tell students to use their ideas to draft each line of the color poem.  Provide a color poem outline (page 76) for students to use, if necessary, for drafting their poems.\n\nRevising/Editing\n\nOnce the poems are drafted, students should share their color poems with peer responders.  Provide the Color Poem Response and Assessment Sheet for this purpose.  Peer responders should check to make sure that each line describes the color through a different sense, that no visual comparisons have been used, and that similes are used in each line.  Responders could also make suggestions for stronger word choice as appropriate.\nFollowing peer response, students should make any necessary revisions before writing a final copy of the poem.\n\nPublishing\r\nStudents could write their final copy of the color poem in the same color ink as their topic and mount it on poster board.  They could then cover the poster board with scraps of material that matches their topic color.  Try to obtain a wide variety of textured materials such as corduroy, silk, cotton, flannel, wallpaper samples, corrugated paper, carpet samples, etc.  This will provide a textured backing to enhance their \"non-visual\" color poem.\n\r\nWhite\r\nWhite is like the sound of ice cubes clinking in a glass.\n\r\nWhite is like the smell of freshly picked daisies from a green, green meadow.\n\r\nWhite is like the taste of sweet, creamy ice cream on a hot summer day.\n\r\nWhite is like the feel of a soft, fluffy pillow comforting you to sleep.\n\r\nBlue\r\nBlue smells like the fresh, salty ocean as the breeze blows across it.\n\r\nBlue sounds like a peaceful river flowing through the forest.\n\r\nBlue tastes like a slippery, sweet lollipop energizing you in the middle of the afternoon.\n\r\nBlue feels like soaring through the air with the birds and the clouds.\n\r\nBrown\r\nBrown is like the taste of rich, thick chocolate as you smooth it around on your tongue.\n\r\nBrown is like the smell of tangy spices, soaking into barbecued meat.\n\r\nBrown is like the sound of construction equipment, struggling to move the earth.\n\r\nBrown is like the feeling of sluggishness, like lying around all day.\n\r\nPink\r\nPink tastes like light, sugary cotton candy you get at the circus.\n\r\nPink smells like a baby just after a bath.\n\r\nPink sounds like tiny, glass wind chimes blowing in the breeze.\n\r\nPink feels like a light feather tickling your skin.",

Writing teachers often allow students to illustrate stories, but it can be very worthwhile to allow students to draw first and write second.\n\nStudent Practice: The exercise on the activity page is adapted from Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain by Betty Edwards.  It is designed to help students think about their writing from an intuitive, \"right-brained\" perspective, as opposed to the rule-bound \"left-brained\" manner of using language.\r\nThe exercise directs the students to create a border around their papers and draw within it objects that are found along the walls of the classroom.\n\r\nAsk students to select one object and write about events or students in the classroom from that object's perspective.  For example, if a student chooses the clock, then he or she might write an essay on time spent in the classroom or changes in the room down through the years.\r\nEncourage students to caption their artwork, as this provides another way for students to self-evaluate their work.\n\nExtension: Ask students to do the same exercise, using a room in their homes.  Students may wish to view a piece of fine artwork and write a story about the scene they encounter.  Students may also wish to select their own previously created works of art and write about the inspiration for their work or create a story around it.",

        "Description": "Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing, Art, Mediums, Techniques",
        "Objective": "Students will tell a short, funny story with the use of words and pictures.  Students will be able to express themselves using comedic writing and pictures.  This type of writing encourages students to be creative and to use detailed pictures to express the plot of a story.",
        "Directions": "Multiple Intelligence Connections\r\nLinguistic-Write a dialogue or story line of a comic or filmstrip.\r\nSpatial-Illustrate a comic or film strip.\r\nBodily-Kinesthetic-Manipulate a film strip; sequence a scrambled comic strip.\r\nLogical-Mathematical-Sequence the logical order of a comic; determine the number of boxes needed for a comic or film strip.\r\nInterpersonal-Peer edit work; share work with the class or partner.\r\nIntrapersonal-Write a first draft; practice for an oral presentation.\r\nMusical-Create a theme song or sound effects for a comic strip; analyze cartoons and their theme songs.\r\nNaturalist-Create a comic about nature and the environment.\n\r\nInstructions\r\nCreating a Comic Strip\n\nEncourage students to look at various comic strips and discuss what they think the artist is trying to say or the theme of the story being told.  Analyze the type of characters in the strips and how the author only uses a limited number of boxes to tell a story of.  Also, discuss how students can improve the comic strip or if it even needs to be improved.  (Note:  Pick a well-known comic strip and compare it to an unknown one.  Ask students what they think makes one comic strip so popular.)\nDistribute a piece of lined paper and a piece of blank paper or Worksheet #1 to each student.  Brainstorm various ideas about which students want to write.  Students may pick a topic in which they are interested in for their first comic strips or you may assign a topic.\nAllow students to decide what their characters are like and what story they want to write about them.  Tell them to write a few notes describing the characters on the lined paper.\nEncourage students to write a short paragraph about the story line under their character descriptions for their comic strips.\nInstruct students to break their short story into sections.  They can do this through either story events or changes in setting.\nStudents draw a detailed picture that explains what each section is about on unlined paper folded into eight squares, or they may use Worksheet #1.  Remind students to leave room for dialogue.\nOn the unlined paper or Worksheet #1, have them transfer the pictures and words needed to help the comic strip make sense.\n\r\nCreating a Film Strip\r\nA film strip can be used to sequence the events of a story or for students to write their own stories.  \r\nThe following are directions for sequencing stories.\n\nRead a story or a chapter book as a class.\nDiscuss the main events of the story.\nDistribute Worksheet #2.  Instruct students to sequence the main events of the story in the order that they happened.\nDirect students to choose four main events, in the story, to illustrate, that will help describe the plot of the story.\nIn the boxes on Worksheet #2, instruct students to illustrate the four events in the order in which they happen.  Tell students they will need to write a sentence summarizing the event in each box on the lines below it.  (Note:  Challenge the students by instructing them to summarize the story in paragraph format, and to use only four boxes to illustrate it.)\n\r\nComic Boxes\n\nExplain to students that they are going to learn about onomatopoeia.  Tell them that onomatopoeia is a big word used to describe sounds like oink or bark.  These words imitate the sound that an object makes, like a clock ticking, a person humming, or an animal growling.\nBrainstorm different objects or things and the sounds they make.  For example, cat--meow; dog--bark; clock--tick--tock, etc.\nDistribute Worksheet #3.  Instruct students that they are going to draw a picture of an object and the sound it makes in the comic boxes on the worksheet.  There should be two objects per box, and the objects should be related.\n\nVariations\n\nEmerging Writers\r\nCut apart a comic strip and make a transparency of each frame.  Display the frames one at a time, allowing students to predict what will happen next in the strip.  Cut apart a progressive comic strip, scramble it, and have students put it back in order.  After students have practiced with various comic strips, make a properly sequenced strip with students using Worksheet #3.  Display transparencies of amusing drawings without captions or other text.  Ask students to suggest funny captions or text for dialogue bubbles.  Students can use their ideas for the basis of a comic or filmstrip.\n\r\nExperienced Writers\r\nHave students do some research on the history of comic strips.  Also, research artists who create comic strips.  If students are especially interested in comic strips, have them write a longer and more in-depth comic book following the same instructions above.  Students can also take an issue that they may face in their daily lives and make a strip about it.  For mature students, the comic strip can be about a political issue.  They can study political cartoons in political magazines or newspapers for ideas.  Finally, students can compare and contrast different comic strips.\n\nEvaluation\r\nThe instructor will be able to check the final project for the following items:\n\nDid the student separate the story into different sections?\nDid the pictures match each section?\nDid the comic strip make sense and follow a sequence?\nDid the student spell the words correctly?\n\n\nExtensions\n\nWatch cartoons in order to listen to their theme songs.  Discuss how the songs match the characters or theme of the show.  Ask students to write their own theme songs for their comic strip.\nCompare and contrast the differences between a comic strip and a television cartoon based on that comic strip.\nSeek out collections of older comics and ask older students to study them.  What themes were important then that seem old-fashioned now?  What themes have remained the same?\nMake simple animated flip books, such as a child kicking a ball.  Discuss with students how they will need to think about motion and slow it down by drawing many pictures.  Students draw their animated activity on small sheets of paper.  They should flip their books before stapling them in order to see if they need to add more drawings.  When the drawings are completed, staple them along one side and invite students to exchange their flip books with one another.\n",

        "Directions": "To begin this activity, review with students what a paragraph is.  Tell them that a paragraph is a smaller unit of a larger piece of writing, just as a fabric square is a smaller unit of a quilt.  A paragraph has a beginning, middle, and end.\n\r\nThe first sentence of a paragraph is the topic sentence.  It tells what the paragraph will be about.  A sentence like \":I go to school,\" is a weak topic sentence because it doesn't tell anything about what you will be saying about going to school.  A topic sentence that says, \"I go to a very strange school,\" is not only more interesting, it tells something about what you will be saying.\n\r\nThe middle of the paragraph contains sentences which follow the topic sentence and add specific details to make the topic more interesting or help explain what you mean.  Every sentence in the middle of the paragraph, or the body, needs to be about the topic stated in the topic sentence.  If you were to use the topic sentence about going to a strange school, a middle sentence might say, \"From a distance my school looks like a space ship.\"\n\r\nThe last sentence of your paragraph is the concluding sentence, or closing.  This sentence reminds the reader of what the topic is about or what it means.  For the paragraph about going to a strange school, this could be a closing sentence: \"Because of its shape, location, and the strange noises coming from the factory down the hill, it is clear that I go to a strange school.\"\n\r\nIntroduce students to the idea of comparison and contrast paragraphs.

        "Directions": "Introduction\r\nCreating a believable person requires more than knowing what the character likes and dislikes.  There are specific types of characters that authors need to place in their stories.  The most common characters, of course, are the hero (protagonist) and the enemy (antagonist).  (For brevity's sake, hero will be used to designate both male and female main characters.)  Most students will probably produce stories with only these two characters, but more sophisticated writers may want to include other types such as the helper and the wise person.\r\nThe hero must be someone with whom the reader can identify, but like a real person, one who cannot be all good.  Not all heroes are equally motivated to face the problems that they will encounter within the story.  The hero also can be any age and from any walk of life.\r\nThe enemy is usually a person who stands in the way of the hero's goal, but it may also be something in the environment. (Spiders and tornadoes come to mind!)  Enemies are not necessarily mean; sometimes they just have a point of view that differs from the hero's.\r\nThe helper may do a number of things, from pointing out possible solutions to creating comic relief.\r\nThe wise person is someone in whom the hero confides or who may have special knowledge that can help the hero obtain his or her goal and experience internal change.\nStudent Practice\r\nDiscuss the characters in works with which you are familiar.  Ask students to help create a brief list of novels they have read and discuss the various character types that appear within these books.  Think about the nature of each hero.  Is each one completely good, or does each have a flaw that gets them into trouble?  Who, or what, is the enemy in the book?  Is there a wise person?  A helper?  Any other character types?  Provide students with copies of page 38 to help them create characters.  For variety, reproduce and laminate page 39, cut out the cards, and make a few sets of character shuffle cards for the class to use.  Students can create new and interesting stories based on the characters they choose from the shuffle cards.\nExtensions\r\nAs a logical extension, ask students to draft stories using the characters they have created.  You may wish to use read-around groups of four or five students in which peer editors judge each other's characters for believability.",

Possible concepts include freedom, jealousy, love, friendship, hope, anger, sadness, independence, time, fear, death, life, etc.\nShare the student sample, \"Hope is . . .\" (page 83).  Read the poem once for students to gain an idea of the form of the poem, which is free verse.\nRead the poem a second time, asking students to list each item that the author compares to hope.\nReview the term metaphor with students.  Ask students why the author compared hope to each of the items.  For example, after reading, \"Hope is a tissue, wiping away your problems and fears,\" ask students, \"Why does the author think hope is like a tissue?\"\nHave students select a topic for their poems from the list the class brainstormed during prewriting.  (Note: Depending on the skill level of your students, you may wish to have students work in groups to write this challenging poem.)\nUsing the Definition Poem Web worksheet, have students make comparisons between their topic and other objects.  The web is designed in two tiers: the first offshoot from the topic is for students to write the objects to be compared; the second offshoot is for elaborating on the comparison.\n\nDrafting\r\nOnce students have generated several comparisons and elaborations, instruct them to begin drafting their definition poem.  Review student sample, Hope is . . . (see the link to the activity pages below) to show students a possible format for their poem. \r\nSince a definition poem is free verse, students could take liberties with the structure of the poem as long as the metaphors are included and complete.\nRevising/Editing\n\nWhen the poem is drafted, students should share their definition poems with peer responders.  Provide the Definition Poem Response and Assessment Sheet for this purpose.  Peer responders should check to make sure that the topic is compared to several items without using like or as, that each comparison is elaborated for explanation, and that each comparison makes sense.\nFollowing peer response, students should make any necessary revisions before writing a final copy of the poem.\n\nPublishing\r\nObtain several old dictionaries that can be torn apart or photocopy pages from a dictionary.  Have the students use the dictionary pages as backgrounds for their poems since they are writing a type of definition.  They should each mount the final copy of their poem on the dictionary page background.",

Write these verbs on chart paper.  Ask the following questions:\r\n    \nHow do these verbs add to the story?\nWere you able to create visual images of the story?\nWhich descriptive words were particularly memorable? \n\n\nExplain that the author uses these verbs to give the reader a clearer visual image of what is happening in the story.\nNext, distribute copies of magazines for the students.  Instruct the students to look for advertisements with descriptive verbs.  \nAs they find the verbs, the students cut them out and glue them onto construction paper.  Have the students store the pages in their writing portfolios for future reference.\nDistribute student copies of Using Descriptive Verbs on page 77.  The students should complete the page by writing a series of descriptive verbs for each verb listed.\nAsk each student to select a previously written story from his or her writing portfolio.  \nInstruct the student to underline all of the verbs used.

To use the feature in Microsoft Word, the student types a verb and then highlights it.  Then the student clicks on Tools in the menu bar at the top of the screen and selects Language . . . Thesaurus from the drop-down menu.  A window will appear, listing different word choices.  The student can select a word from the window to replace the word that was originally highlighted.\nInstruct students to read two or three articles from magazines or newspapers.

Reproduce and cut out a Diamond Design pattern for each student in the class.\nLesson Plan\nPrewriting\n\nDistribute one diamond cutout to each student at the beginning of class.  Instruct students to read the word on their diamond and locate the student who has the diamond with the opposite of their diamond word.  Allow students time to move around the room to locate their opposite partner.  Once students have located their partner, instruct them to sit together.

The poem should be written in the following pattern:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine 1\n\n\r\n                Opposite #1\n\n\n\n\nLine 2\n\n\r\n                2 adjectives describing Opposite #1\n\n\n\n\nLine 3\n\n\r\n                3 verbs related to Opposite #1\n\n\n\n\nLine 4\n\n\r\n                2 nouns related to Opposite #1; 2 nouns related to Opposite #2\n\n\n\n\nLine 5\n\n\r\n                3 verbs related to Opposite #2\n\n\n\n\nLine 6\n\n\r\n                2 adjectives describing Opposite #2\n\n\n\n\nLine 7\n\n\r\n                Opposite #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevising/Editing\n\nWhen the poem is drafted, students should share their diamante with another pair of students.  Provide the Diamante Response and Assessment Sheet for this purpose.  Peer responders should check to make sure the correct format has been followed, including the number of words and parts of speech.  Students should also make sure that the poem resembles a diamond shape.\nFollowing peer response, students should make any necessary revisions before writing a final copy of the poem.\n\nPublishing\r\nStudents could write their diamante on a piece of white paper and mount it on a piece of construction paper or aluminum foil cut in the shape of a large diamond; the Diamond Design could be used by students to trace the shape of a diamond.  They could attach the poem to two other diamonds illustrating the opposites they wrote about in their poem.  The finished product is a string of three diamonds connected together, with the poem in the middle.  These look wonderful hanging from the ceiling or walls as a classroom display.  (Be sure to check on your school or district policy on hanging items from the ceiling before doing so.)\n\r\nStudent Samples of Diamantes\r\ntropical\r\nwarm, summery\r\nswimming, sunning, surfing\r\nsandy beaches, hula girls, polar bears, Santa Claus\r\nfreezing, snowing, blowing\r\ncold, wintry\r\nArctic\r\nsad\r\nlonely, weepy\r\ncrying, wishing, missing\r\nhurt, tears, smile, joy\r\nlaughing, clapping, leaping\r\nexcited, cheery\r\nglad\r\nhot\r\nsteamy, humid\r\nburning, sizzling, cooking\r\nfire, heat, ice, snow\r\nblowing, biting, freezing\r\nfrigid, chilly\r\ncold\n\nCurriculum Connections for Diamantes\nLanguage Arts\r\nSuppose your language arts teacher has asked you to compare two very different characters from a story you have been reading.

        "Directions": "Teacher Information\r\nSome plants produce two kinds of flowers on the same plant.  One will have only stamens, the other only pistils.  These are incomplete flowers.  There are also composite flowers (such as dandelions and marigolds) which consist of many complete flowers clustered into one.  The flowers used for this activity should have both stamens and a pistil, known as a complete flower.  These include flowers like the lily, gladiola, tulip, and fruit blossoms.  Select the largest flowers for this lesson and provide a variety of them.\nActivity\r\nAsk the students if they know how seeds are produced.  Tell them they are about to take a flower apart so they can see where seeds are formed.  If the students are too young to dissect flowers alone, do this activity as a demonstration.\r\nDistribute data sheets, flowers, magnifiers, and clear tape to students and let them follow the data sheets as they dissect the flower.\nClosure\r\nUse the transparency How Flowers Reproduce (page 26) to explain the reproduction process to students.  Tell them bees are the best pollinators of flowers.  When a bee goes to a flower to get nectar and pollen, some pollen drops off the bee's body onto the sticky stigma on the pistil.  Beekeepers often rent hives to farms with apple orchards or other trees needing to be pollinated.  Other insects which visit flowers also pollinate them.  Pollen can also be transferred to the stigma by wind and by some birds and bats.\r\nExplain that fruits and vegetables are really swollen ovaries of a blossom that grew on the plant.  Show students an apple and point out the leftover blossom and stem on opposite ends.  Cut the apple open to expose the seeds formed inside the ovary.  Let the students examine the seeds. \r\nSave the students' flower parts to be used in the next lesson and in the plant journal.\nExtender\r\nTake students on a walk to search for fruit-bearing plants that show blossoms and fruit.  Try to find examples of the transition from blossom to fruit on a plant.  Cut open a blossom to expose the swollen ovary inside, the beginning of the fruit.\r\nHave students examine a dandelion flower and one which has gone to seed.  This is a great example of a composite flower.  Each seed is formed in its own flower but combined with others.",

        "Objective": "Students will use red cabbage juice as an indicator dye to identify acids and bases.",
        "Directions": "Follow the recipe below to make about a pint of cabbage indicator dye.\r\nRed Cabbage Indicator Dye\r\nMaterials:  1/4 head red cabbage chopped into small pieces water, glass bowl, microwave \r\nDirections:  Chop the cabbage into small pieces and place them in the bowl. Add just enough water to cover the cabbage and bring it to a boil.  Boil for 3-4 minutes more.  Pour the contents into a strainer and drain off the liquid into a container.  Refrigerate until ready to use. \r\nLabel the 6 oz. (178 mL) cups \"cabbage indicator dye\" and fill them about 1/2 full.  Place a dropper in each of these cups.\r\nPour the vinegar and ammonia into dropper bottles and label them. Give each group a set.  \r\n(Note:  Ammonia can not be in an open container, due to the fumes. If droppers are used, fill the droppers 1/4 full, and give one to each group.)\r\nFill the test tubes 1/2 full with the dye and set them in the rack.  Optional:  Use inverted paper or Styrofoam cups with a hole in the bottom just large enough to hold the test tube.\nActivity\n\nBegin this lesson with a \"Magic Show\".  Place the test tubes with the dye in them where all students can see them.  Have ready a vial of pH paper with the color code, and a bottle of ammonia and vinegar with the label concealed. Tell the students you are going to perform a magic show that they are to watch and be ready to write an explanation of what they saw.  Follow the steps below.\r\n    \nShow the students the test tubes with the blue dye in it and have them note the color.\nInto one of the tubes place three drops of vinegar and shake it.  Let the students observe the color changed from blue to pink (or red).\nDrop three drops of ammonia into another tube and shake it.  Have the students observe that the color of the blue dye is now green.\n\n\nHave each student write and draw what they think caused the color change.  When they finish this, discuss it with them.\nIntroduce the students to the pH paper and show them the color code inside the bottle.  Explain that this is a special paper which changes color to show if something is an acid or base.\r\n    \nTake one of the pH strips and place the lower half into the dye with no additives in it. Show the students the color change and hold the paper against the color code to match it.  Write the pH number on the board and show that it identifies this as a neutral substance.  Repeat this with the other test tubes, showing the dye with vinegar is acid and the ammonia a base. \n\n\nProvide each group with a cup of the dye, three 1 oz. (30 mL) cups, ammonia and vinegar bottles, and a copy of the data chart (page 43).  Have them use the dropper to fill the small cups just enough to cover the bottom of it.  Tell the students to follow the #1 chart and conduct the tests on the substances.  Explain that they should only use one or two drops of the vinegar and ammonia and then, record the results on the chart as they work.\nReview the results the groups have recorded.  \n\nClosure\n\nRepeat the same tests, but this time provide students with a mystery liquid to test.  This should be either an acid or base made by adding a few drops of vinegar or ammonia to 1 oz. (30 mL) cup of water.  Do not provide the same mystery liquids to all groups so some will find it a base while others find it an acid.  \nStudents should use a dropper (or half of a straw) to transfer a few drops of the mystery liquid into the dye.  They may use the pH paper dipped into the mystery liquid to get its value.\nAfter they have identified the mystery liquid as acid or base, reissue the dropper bottles of vinegar and ammonia to them.  Have them add drops of the opposite type of liquid to their mystery liquid and test it again.\nLet them repeat this test again, but this time they use the dropper bottle with the matching acid or base as the mystery liquid was originally.  Note: The groups should use the same container of mystery liquid throughout these tests.  \nDiscuss their results, all will not be the same.  Let them see that as they add the opposite (base or acid) to their mystery liquid, it begins to approach neutral. \n\n\nExtenders\n\nLet the students continue adding drops to the mystery liquid to achieve neutral if they can.  Their pH paper will be the best identifier for this test.\nSend home the recipe for cabbage indicator dye along with a note to explain what the class has been doing.  Encourage the parents to make the dye with their children and repeat the tests, using household items such as tea, shampoo, crushed and liquefied Tums™.  Provide a time for the students to report their results to the class.\n",

        "Directions": "Facts to Know\r\nYou often hear commercials about savings at stores.  Sometimes, the announcer will say in the same breath, \"We're having our biggest sale of the year, and all items have been discounted by 30-50% off!\"\r\nWell, what's the difference between things being on sale and things being discounted?\r\nHaving a sale is the act of selling at lower prices than usual, as in \"Dorothy's House of Dresses is having a sale on skirts and jackets.\"\r\nA discount is used by manufacturers and merchants to mean taking off a certain percentage of the price given in a price list.  This price is called the list price.  The list price less the discount is known as the net price.  The noun \"discount\" can be used as a verb, too--\"We're discounting by 15% the list price on all new cars and trucks during our storewide 'Get into Spring' sale!\"\r\nYou can ask, \"What's the discount?\" but you would never ask, \"What's the sale?\"\r\nOften you have to figure out your own savings during a sale, and this is when an understanding of decimals and percents comes in handy.\r\nSample\r\nA local carnival is offering a single, one-day pass to all rides for $12.50 or a special two-day pass for $20.00.  You do some quick decimal arithmetic.\nCost of 2 one-day passes\r\n$12.50 x $2.82 = $25.00\n2 one-day passes - special two-day pass\r\n$25.00 - $20.00 = $5.00\r\nSo your savings on a two-day pass is $5.00.\r\nBut what percent off is that?\nCross Multiply\r\n$5.00/$25.00 = x/100\r\n25x = 500\r\nx = 20 or 20% off",

An international conference was held in 1884 to set up time zones.  The Greenwich Observatory in England was chosen as the starting point, and from this point, there would be 12 time zones to the east and 12 to the west.  Today, however, there are two half-hour time zones.  India, which spans two time zones, has chosen a single time midway between the two times.  When it is noon in London, for instance, it is 5:30 p.m. in central India.  The central part of Australia has a fractional time zone, too.\r\nEach zone is one hour different from those on either side of it.  Across the oceans, the time zone borders run mostly north and south.  Across land, the borders follow political boundaries--the borders of nations and states, mainly.  There are six times zones total in the United States.  As you travel west, subtract one hour.  As you travel east, add one hour.\r\nDistribute the activity pages to students and have them use what they have learned to complete the activity.",

(http://www.yahoo.com).\r\nOnce the students have launched their search engines, have them type the country they are researching in the search box. \r\nYou will then see how many sites met the search (often times the number will be well over 1,000).  Usually the best sites are in the first 25 or 30.\r\nStudents will find information on a city or country in Europe.  To find flight prices, your students may want to go directly to an airline Web site such as http://www.usair.com. \r\nStudents will continue to find information about their city or country, such as popular foods, currency, weather, and fun facts.

They hope to undo their opinions and preferences and reach a state of satori, or illumination. With this clarity, they can live calmly and compassionately in the world. \nIntroduce the topic of meditation to students with the following How to Meditate passage.\nHow to Meditate\r\nYou have probably heard the word \"meditation\" many times in your life. You may have seen pictures of people sitting in meditation with crossed legs and eyes closed. You may even know someone who meditates. But what exactly is meditation? What is its purpose? In all traditions of Buddhism, followers meditate in order to still their minds, to let go of the running thoughts inside their brains and purify it of greed, hatred, and ignorance. If you stop to notice, thoughts go on from the moment of waking until sleep. They even appear in dreams. For Buddhists, meditation is a means of finding what lies beyond these thoughts. Of course, this takes practice.\nThere are many forms of meditation. Usually, Buddhists sit still, spine straight and eyes closed. By focusing on their breath, they become more present, more aware of themselves. Although the stream of thoughts continues, the student simply watches them go by like clouds in the sky. Thus, he or she begins to be free of the grip of thinking.\nZen Buddhists have some unusual entries to meditation practices. One such entry is called a koan, or a riddle. The master asks a puzzling question which the student must answer correctly--although it may take days to comprehend! Thus, the koan provides the means for meditation.\nTibetan Buddhists like to focus on mandalas during meditation. Mandalas are elaborate designs rich with color and detail. They are often circular, containing either portraits of various gods or intricate patterns. After meditating on the mandala, the student will close his or her eyes and try to visualize the picture. Thus, the mind is disciplined while the heart merges with the spirit of the mandala.\nDistribute the Mandalas activity sheet to students . Have them color the mandalas provided and then create their own. \nExtension\nHave students try sitting quietly five minutes a day. Suggest that they just sit and listen to the sounds around them, even the sound of their breathing. After a few days, try ten minutes. Have them keep journals of their quiet time experiences.",

        "Directions": "If the names of famous Olympians were placed end to end, they could probably circle the globe many times. This activity provides an introduction to a few who earned the gold. Students may wish to read to find out more about them. It is hoped that they will continue their search to become acquainted with other equally famous Olympic Games stars.\nU.S. Olympic Games Stars\nIn Athletics (track and field) events, the name of Jesse Owens, the sharecropper's son from Alabama, always tops the list of favorite Olympians. His four gold medals won at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games discredited Hitler's notion of German superiority over other races.\r\nIn 1984, another track sensation by the name of Carl Lewis matched Jesse Owens' performance of 28 years before and went on to excel in the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Games.\r\nBabe Didrikson was the track star of the 1932 Olympic Games, capturing a gold medal for the U.S. in the javelin throw and another in the 800-meter hurdles. She went on to become a golf star and is still considered one of the most versatile female athletes.\r\nThe decathlon winner usually holds the honor of being considered the world's best athlete. In 1948, Bob Mathias became the youngest man to earn the gold. Four years later he won again at the age of 21. Other honored decathlon winners include Rafer Johnson (1960), Bill Toomey (1968), Bruce Jenner (1976), and Dan O'Brien (1996).\r\nSwimming and diving have seen their champions, too. After winning five gold medals in swimming in 1924 and 1928, Johnny Weissmuller went on to play the original Tarzan. Patricia McCormick practiced over 100 dives a day to achieve her goal. She swept the diving events for the United States in both the 1956 and 1960 Olympic Games. Her daughter also went on to medal in diving in the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Games. \r\nGreg Louganis, protégé of the 1948 Olympic Games diving star Dr. Sammy Lee, began his Olympic diving carreer in 1976, winning the silver medal on platform at the age of 16. Louganis won gold medals in the 1984 and 1988 Games. After winning two bronze medals in 1968, Mark Spitz came back to earn seven gold medals in swimming events in the l972 Olympic Games in Munich.\r\nEddie Eagan won a gold medal in boxing in 1920 and another in four-man bobsledding in 1932. He is the only athlete to have won a gold medal in both the Olympic Games and the Olympic Winter Games.\r\nIn 1980, speed skater Eric Heiden became the first to win five individual gold medals in his sport. Speed skater Bonnie Blair won five gold medals between 1988 and 1994.\r\nThe sport of figure skating has brought the gold to the U.S. quite often. Winners include Tenley Albright (1956), Carol Heiss (1960), Peggy Fleming (1968), Dorothy Hamill (1976), Kristy Yamaguchi (1992), and Tara Lipinski (1998). Dick Button was a two-time gold medal winner for the men (1948 and 1952) and continued to participate in many Olympic Games as a television commentator on his sport. Hayes Alan Jenkins won a skating gold in 1956, and his brother David took it in 1960. Other men's winners include Scott Hamilton (1984) and Brian Boitano (1988).\r\nSome of the most familiar names among past U.S. Olympians are found in the boxing world. Floyd Patterson won the gold for the United States in the 1952 Games and later became the heavyweight champion of the world. George Foreman won the gold in the super heavyweight division in 1968. As a professional, he defeated the 1964 winner, Joe Frazier. Later he lost to the gold medal winner of the 1960 Games, Cassius Clay, known to boxing fans as Muhammad Ali.\r\nOther famous U.S. Olympians include:\r\nAndrea Mead Lawrence of Vermont who was the first U.S. woman to win two medals in Alpine skiing.\r\nHarrison \"Bones\" Dillard who was considered one of the greatest hurdlers of all times. He won four gold medals for the U.S. in 1948 and 1952.\r\nAl Oerter who threw the discus to win the gold in four Olympic Games (1956-1968).\r\nParry O'Brian who threw the shot put in four Olympic Games (1952-1964) for two gold medals and a silver medal.\r\nForeign Stars \r\nLeonidas of Rhodes, perhaps the greatest runner of all time, won the 200- meter, 400- meter, and hoplite in four Olympic Games from 164 b.c. to 152 b.c.\r\nPaavo Nurmi, known as the \"flying Finn,\" first competed in 1920. He won seven gold and three silver medals for Finland over three Olympic Games. He was known for his explosive starts and habit of boasting ahead of time about his winning performances.\r\nDaley Thompson of Great Britain became the pride of his country by winning the decathlon in 1980 and 1984.\r\nDawn Fraser, Australia's popular freestyle swimmer, competed in three successive Olympic Games (1956, 1960, and 1964). She earned one silver and five gold medals.\r\nSonja Henie of Norway was only 11 years old when she appeared in her first Olympic Games in 1924. She did not win that year, but she later won three gold medals in figure skating (1928, 1932, and 1936). After her figure skating career she became a popular movie star. \r\nIn 1956, Anton (Tony) Sailer became the hero of Austria as the first skier to sweep gold medals in all three Alpine events.\r\nIn 1968, Jean Claude Killy of France succeeded in repeating Sailer's feat. In 1992, he was once again in the spotlight as he secured and organized the Games for Albertville, France. These Games took place in the Alpine mountains only a few miles from where Killy had grown up and first learned to ski.\r\nThe West Germans were hoping for the same three Alpine medals in 1976 from their skiing sensation, Rosi Mittermaier. She won the first two races but lost the Giant Slalom by only .12 of a second.\r\nThe beginning of the gymnastic craze is often credited to 17-year-old Olga Korbut of the Soviet Union, but she did not win a gold medal in individual event competition. Her aggressive and daring style amazed the fans at the 1972 Games. Four years later, Nadia Comaneci of Romania collected seven perfect tens, the highest score in gymnastics. Nadia won three gold medals in Montreal in 1976 and two in Moscow in 1980.\r\nThe continent of Africa has been the home of many brilliant runners. Abebe Bikila, used to running barefoot in his native Ethiopia, saw no reason to put on shoes as he ran the marathon in the 1960 Olympic Games. After winning the gold medal in two hours and 15 minutes, he still had enough energy to take a victory lap around the stadium. In 1964, he again won the marathon, this time wearing shoes. He is the only man in Olympic Games history to win two consecutive marathons.\r\nRunner Kipchoge Keino of Kenya won two gold and two silver medals over two Olympic Games (1968 and 1972). He wore a cap when he raced and delighted in tossing it to the crowd as he completed his final lap.\r\nDistribute the activity sheet to students and have them use their newfound knowledge of Olympic athletes to complete the page.",

        "Objective": "Students will identify the order of societal rank and loyalties within feudal Europe.",
        "Directions": "Preparation\r\nReproduce and cut out the role identification cards on page 38 in the following class percentages (approximate): Noble (10%); Vassal (30%); Peasant (55%). Prepare only one King identification card since there will be only one student in this role at any given time. For example, in a class of 21 students, roles could be assigned as follows: 1 King, 2 Nobles, 6 Vassals, and 12 Peasants. (See diagram on page 39.)\r\nThe Noble, Vassal, and Peasant cards need to be categorized into two respective domains: one-half of each are to be marked A, and the other half are to be labeled with a B.  If you have a third noble, the role cards would be divided into thirds.  Depending upon the number of students, you may have to alter the number of cards slightly to keep the approximate proportions.\r\nThroughout the activity there can be only one king. The ratio of total students in the class to nobles should be about 10 to 1.\r\nMake a transparency of a Feudal Classroom that represents your students. Use the sample diagram on page 39 as a guide.\nProcedure\r\nHave students draw identification role cards at random.\r\nThen, depending on whether they belong to the realm of Noble A or that of Noble B, students should arrange their desks similar to the diagram on page 39, which the teacher should place on the overhead projector. (If an overhead projector is not available, simply reproduce the diagram onto a chart or copy it on the chalkboard.)\r\nArrange the room to approximate the diagram. (Availability of space will dictate the room arrangement and necessary modifications.)\r\nGive each student or member of the realm a paper cup containing ten M&M's. The nobles and vassals should also be given a plastic spoon or a glove. The candy is to represent the harvest reaped in a particular year by the peasants.\r\nSince the peasants were paying for their protection with their crops, have the vassals confiscate six M&M's from each peasant using their spoons or rubber gloves. (The lines on the diagram indicate the number of peasants to each vassal.)\r\nFrom each peasant's payment, the vassal is to keep one piece and give five to his lord, the noble.\r\nFrom each vassal's payment of fidelity, or loyalty, the noble is to keep two pieces and give three candies to the king (once again using the spoon or glove).\r\nUsing the classroom arrangement on page 39 and the procedures above, the final candy distribution might look like this: the peasants, 4 candies; the vassals, 12 candies; the nobles, 22 candies; the king, a lusty 46 candies.\nFor Discussion\r\nIn the early medieval period, the rights of man were not a major concern; survival was.  At the end of this activity, students will no doubt complain that the king now has 46 pieces of candy while they, as peasants, have but four.  Turn those concerns into constructive and informative discussions about the roles within and aspects of the feudal system by asking the following questions:  What need would the nobles and king have for all that food and material?  What choice did the peasants have?  Why did feudalism work?",

        "Directions": "Description\r\nThis activity could be a part of a larger unit on weather or on graphing.  Using e-mail, students will collect the high and low temperature readings from a variety of locations.  By using e-mail as opposed to online or print sources, students can also explore differences in microclimates within their own region.  They will plot the locations on a map.  Using the information they have gathered, students will look for patterns and will predict future temperatures.  \nProcedure\n\nBe sure that students have an outdoor thermometer that is easily accessible from the classroom.  Prepare a class-size chart like the one on page 75 on which the students can record your local temperatures.\nHave students record the temperatures each day at the opening bell, at lunch, and at the end of the school day.  Keep this record for five to seven days.\nPost these results on a board or chart.  At the end of the week, ask students what they notice.  Accept all conclusions.\nHave the class use the Internet to help them collect other temperature data.  Explain that it will be easier to explore variations in temperature if you have a wider group of samples.  Ask students how they might accomplish this.  Also discuss whether the collection method used in your class would be effective in collecting data from others.  If you wish, they can record their data on the chart (page 75).\nCompile a list of information sources, using either locally generated contacts or a Web site like ePals.\r\n    http://www.epals.com\r\n    Create a time line for completing the project.  Determine how the data will be entered.  A spreadsheet is a useful tool.  Who will do this data entry?\nCreate an e-mail message explaining your project and generate a reporting form to standardize data collection (see the sample on the next page).  If you send the form as an attachment, participants can respond more easily.\nGather your data.  Perhaps a group of students can be responsible for managing information from each remote site.\nAt the close of the data gathering phase, have each student group report on their data.  Ask that they include numerical and graphical reports.  This project lends itself to real-time work with mean, median, range, etc.  What conclusions has each group drawn from the data?  What conclusions can the class as a whole draw from the data?\nUse chat or Instant Messaging to share information among participants.\n\nAssessment\r\nStudents can be graded on the presentation and analysis of data and the level of participation for students within a group.",

        "Directions": "Preparation\r\nMake an overhead transparency of each of the pictographs on the accompanying sheets.\nProcedure\n\nWhile engaged in the study of a unit on the Byzantine Empire, surprise students at the beginning of the class period with the announcement of a \"pop\" quiz.  They need to get out a sheet of paper and number it one to five.\nThe quiz will consist of each of the five pictograph transparencies that students will try to identify by correctly naming them on their papers.\nWhen the last of the pictographs has been displayed, collect the quizzes.  Then survey students as to their opinions of the quiz:  What did you like about the quiz?  What was unusual about the quiz format?  Did you think it was fair?  Would you like future quizzes like this one if they weren't surprise quizzes?\nThe intent of the previous questions is to hopefully engender a discussion where the class presents diverse points of view regarding the quiz's symbolic nature.  Those students who are more visual learners may have liked to take the pictographs quiz.  Other students may very well have resented being evaluated on the basis of symbols they did not create or that had not been previously reviewed.\nAssure students that the quiz will not count as a grade.  Rather, use the simulation as an introduction for a lesson on one of the divisions that developed between the Church of the Western Roman Empire (Roman Catholic) and the Church of the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire (Greek Orthodox).  (See background information below.)\n\nBackground\r\nIn the eighth century A.D., many Christians in the former Roman Empire used icons, or religious images, to assist in their worship services.  In the Byzantine Empire (the eastern half of the former Roman Empire centered in Constantinople), disagreements developed as to whether or not icons broke the second commandment which prohibited the making of graven images.\r\nWhile the emperor of the Byzantine Empire tried to wrestle his people away from icon worship, the leaders of the Roman Church in Italy became upset with the Byzantines.  Since most people in Western Europe at this time could not read, icons were valuable assets in teaching Christianity.  The Pope and other church leaders in Rome summarily dismissed the Byzantine emperor from the Christian church.\r\nEven though the Byzantine emperor eventually allowed his people to keep icons in their worship, the rift that originated between the eastern and western branches of Christianity over icon worship grew wider and wider with each century.  By the middle of the eleventh century, the Roman Catholic Church and the Greek Orthodox Church were completely separate entities.\nExtension\r\nPictographs can be a unique way for students to visualize the meanings of various terms.  Having students create their own pictographs and sharing them with classmates is a refreshingly different way to review vocabulary.",

The point of the game is to communicate without speaking.\r\nTeacher Instructions:  Prepare squares of folded paper, one for each participant.  Place a dot on one of the squares; leave the other squares blank.  Cut out the squares and then fold each of them so that no one can see the dot.  Place the squares in a container and have each participant draw one.  The person who draws the dot is the zapper.  He or she should tell no one.\r\nRules of the Game\n\nEach player--including the zapper--receives a form (page 87).  The object is to, without speaking, get a different person to sign each line of the form.  (Players may allow someone to sign more than one line if everyone else has signed and there are still blank lines left.)\nThe zapper must attempt to zap people by winking at an individual without drawing the attention of the other players.  If he winks at everyone before he is discovered, he wins the game.\nWhen someone is winked at, they are out of the game.  They may no longer try to complete their form.  Also, they may not reveal the identity of the zapper to those still in the game.\nThe game may also be won by contestants who complete the form before everyone is zapped.  Just announce you are the winner when the form is completed.  Do not speak until that point!\nAnother way to win the game is to announce correctly who the zapper is.  This cannot be done when he has zapped you.  You must observe him zapping someone else.  If you proclaim someone the zapper and are incorrect, you are out of the game.\nAnyone who speaks for any reason other than those previously mentioned is disqualified from the game.\n",

        "Directions": "Background Information\r\nKwanzaa (pronounced Kwahn-zaah) is a relatively new holiday, begun in 1966 by an African American named Maulana Ron Karenga, a professor of Black Studies at the California State University at Long Beach.  Celebrated from December 26 through January 1, Kwanzaa is a time when people of African descent can honor the customs of their ancestors.\r\nIn the Swahili language, the word kwanzaa means \"first.\"  The holiday received its name because in Africa so many tribes celebrated the first harvest of their crops each year.  The celebration dates were chosen to correspond with the African harvest festivals, usually held in late December and early January.\r\nKwanzaa is not a religious or political holiday.  It is a cultural celebration based on seven principles which serve as a guide for daily living, and which came from family beliefs in many parts of Africa.  The seven principles are referred to as the Nguzo Saba (en-goo-zo sah-bah).  The seven principles are:  Unity, Self-Determination, Collective Work and Responsibility, Cooperative Economics, Purpose, Creativity, and Faith.  The activity sheets attached are bulletin board patterns for the seven principles.\r\nDuring Kwanzaa, a special candleholder called a kinara is lit each evening to celebrate one of the seven principles.  This kinara is symbolic of the family's African ancestors.  As a candle is lit, the family talks about the special meaning of the day.  The candles are only part of the holiday.  Family and friends enjoy special foods, such as fruits and vegetables, and small homemade gifts are exchanged.  A karamu, or feast, is held on the last day with music and dancing.\nActivity Description\r\nThe Arabs call this game Kalah.  They brought it to Africa where it has many different names.  In East Africa it is called Mankala.  In West Africa, it is called Owara.  In South Africa it is known as Ohora.\r\nYou can make this game out of an empty egg carton.  The end sections are the Kalahs.  Each player's Kalah is on his or her right.  These sections count as cups during the game.\nActivity Directions\nBuild the game board by separating the top and bottom of the egg carton.  Cut the top section in half and affix each half to the side of the bottom section (be sure you put the top with the flat part down so that it forms cups at the ends of the egg carton).\nPlay starts when the players put three beans into each of the small cups on their own sides.\nThe first player begins by taking all of the beans out of one of his or her cups and moving to the right, dropping one bean into each of the next three cups.  Remember, the Kalah counts as a cup after play begins.\nIf the first player is able to drop the bean into his or her own Kalah, he/she gets another turn.  If the last (third) bean does not end up in his/her own Kalah, it becomes the other player's turn.\nEach player continues to take turns trying to get as many beans as possible into his/her own Kalah, until all the cups on one player's side are empty.\nThe winner is the player with the most beans in his/her Kalah.",

The remainder of the class should receive cards marked Peasants.  You may wish to use heavy stock that can be laminated so that cards may be held for future use.\nUsing an overhead transparency or the chalkboard, recreate the seating diagram so students can easily position themselves according to its layout.\n\nProcedure\n\nUse the sample diagram to reposition the desks in your room before the students arrive for the start of the day.  (Note: The sample is set to a standard rectangular room formation; feel free to improvise the seating to meet your individual room configuration.  It is only necessary to maintain the concentric effect of Priests/Nobles in the center followed by an outer ring of Artisans/Merchants with Peasants on the exterior fringes).\nAs students enter the classroom, randomly dispense the role cards one by one.\nInstruct students to view the seating diagram and sit in any position that corresponds to their specific role cards.\n\r\n    (Note: You should be sure to collect the role cards once all students have been properly seated.  This is especially important if you teach in a departmentalized format where several classes will enter your room throughout the course of a day.)\n\nBefore the instructor proceeds with the day's lesson about the Mayan civilization, he or she should inform the students that the peculiar seating arrangement represents the layout of a typical Mayan city.  The teacher may ask students to offer conjecture as to the significance of this residential pattern.  (See Background, page 87.)  Depending upon the content of previous lessons, students may readily offer an accurate explanation, or they may just hypothesize if \"Urban Planning\" is being used as an anticipatory set for information that is to be initially presented on that day.\n\nBackground\r\nThe Mayan civilization of southern Mexico and northern Central America (Guatemala, Belize) reached its height between the third and tenth centuries, A.D.  Its cities were focal points of religious celebrations involving pyramid-style temples and the worship of numerous gods.  Government was conducted and priests and rulers lived in these communities as well.\r\nTo that end, the hub of a Mayan city was its temple with priests residing close by.  Since nobility ruled, ruling families also lived close to the city's center.  With declining status, people lived farther away from the core of the city.  Wealthy artisans and merchants resided farther out than the ruling classes, yet they were much closer than the multitude of peasants.  They were farthest removed as they took care of the fields on the perimeter of a city.\r\nOnce again, \"Urban Planning\" takes some flexibility on the part of the teacher.  For a day, it offers a bit of variety to the class(es) as it attempts to illuminate one aspect of life in a once dominant civilization.",

When he was seven years old, his family moved to southwest Indiana where Lincoln helped to clear the fields and plant crops.  His mother died when he was nine years old and his father remarried about a year later.  He got along well with his stepmother and her three children.  The family made another move to Illinois in 1830.  Abraham was 21 years old and six feet four inches tall.  He was muscular and physically powerful.   \r\nAbraham once said he went to school by \"the littles\"--a little now and a little then.   He enjoyed reading and was a self-taught prairie lawyer.  His political future began to take shape with his successful legal career in Springfield, Illinois.  He ran for public office several times and served in the Illinois legislature and as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\r\nHe married Mary Todd on November 4, 1842.  They had four children, Robert (the only one who lived to adulthood), Edward, William, and Thomas (\"Tad\").\r\nIn 1858 he was the Republican candidate for the Senate.  Though he was not an abolitionist, he was morally against slavery, a practice he had seen years before while visiting New Orleans. He ran against Stephen Douglas, and though he did not win, their debates made him famous.   He was devoted to the cause of personal freedom for all people.\r\nIn 1860 Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States.  As expected, the Southern (slave) states withdrew from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America.  He led the North through the Civil War and wrote the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing the slaves.  At Gettysburg, he gave one of his most famous speeches, declaring that government \"of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" \r\nThe war ended just as he was beginning his second term as president.  He was planning the reconstruction of the United States.  Within days of his second inauguration, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth.  He died early on the morning of April 15, 1865.\nExtension Activities\n\nLincoln was born in Kentucky.  He moved to Indiana at age seven.  At 17 he built a flatboat and ran farm products down the Mississippi River to New Orleans.  He married Mary Todd at her sister's home in Springfield, Illinois.  He was named the Republican presidential candidate in Chicago, Illinois, and delivered his most famous speech at the battlefield cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  He was assassinated at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C.  Locate and label these locations on a map of the United States.\nLincoln was more interested in preserving the Union than ending slavery.  Discuss the arguments for and against secession.\nMake a list of words that describe Abraham Lincoln, his appearance and personality.  Organize them into a character sketch.\nRead more information about the Confederacy and the Union.  What were the strengths and weaknesses of each group?  Make a chart to show what you learn.  Compare the advantages of the North and South.  Which group do you think seemed likely to win? \nDo research to learn the major battles of the Civil War.  Locate and label them on a map of the United States.  Indicate which side was victorious in each. \nAs a result of the war, Clara Barton founded the American Red Cross to help people in need.  What duties do women perform (then and now) in time of war?  How does the Red Cross respond to disasters today?  What can you do to contribute to the organization?  \n",

        "Objective": "Students explain why Americans were upset with British tax laws, such as the Stamp Act, after the French and Indian war.  They will also identify two tactics colonials used to demonstrate their displeasure with these taxes.",
        "Directions": "Prepare the Role Cards as directed on the pages.\n\r\nCut out the Object Cards.  Label the six cards with names of items commonly worn or possessed by students in class--e.g., jeans, running shoes, glasses, pens, jewelry.  You do not need to use all six cards; three to six cards seem to work well for this simulation.  In the corner box of each of the object cards, write a number ranging from one to three.  As will be explained later, these numbers will represent a taxable value.\n\r\nAt the start of class give each student a paper cup containing ten candies.  Instruct students not to touch the candies.Randomly pass out the Role Cards to students.  Explain that those possessing King, Parliament, and Tax Collector cards should proceed to the front of the room.  The king should take a designated seat of honor, and the members of Parliament should also have a specific area from which they will enact their roles.Members of Parliament (those students possessing Parliament Role Cards) will draw from your previously compiled and prepared group of Object Cards.  Parliament members announce to the Colonists what item is to be taxed (e.g., blue jeans), and anyone possessing that item will have to pay out the number of candies equal to the number written on the Object Card.  So if the card marked blue jeans-3 is pulled, each colonist wearing blue jeans would relinquish three candies. Those students possessing Tax Collector role cards do all of the collecting using plastic spoons or gloves and all taxes (candies) are returned to Parliament.  (Each tax collector has charge over half the room,)  Taxes should be levied for at least three items but not more than six.  If you have a good idea of what is popular in student dress, four items seems to be an optimum number for successfully relieving several students of all their candy and leaving many more with just one or two of their original total.\n\r\nAfter all taxes have been levied, these funds are to be dispersed.  The tax collectors each reap ten percent of the take.  Parliament receives fifty percent (these funds are to be used to run the empire) to be split equally among the two students in that role.  Finally, King George pockets the remaining forty percent for himself.  (These percentages have no real historical significance and are only an arbitrary breakdown for purposes to fit this simulation.)  It is quite possible that while some students will have had all of their  candies confiscated, members of Parliament and the king will have upwards of thirty to forty pieces each to show for their efforts.\n\r\nSome students may show definite feelings of displeasure just as some on the receiving end of this taxing generosity may gloat just a bit too much.  The objective for this lesson should be completed during the withdrawl from the roles. Understanding how the colonists reacted to the tax collectors and the various tax laws from the Stamp Act and beyond will be relevant to the class at this crucial moment.  Discuss the following \n\r\nquestions:\n\n What was so unfair about how the class was taxed?\nHow could it have been handled more fairly?\nWhy were tax collectors tarred and feathered?\nWhat methods and organizations were devised by the colonists in order to resist and circumvent these laws?\nHow significant were these laws to the ultimate break of Great Britain?\n\n\r\nThe frustration that the students feel with the unfairness of the way they lost their candy can be easily compared to the substantial give and take on one of the central issues leading to revolution--taxation without representation.",

See Procedure, step 3.)\nCut out each rune (with its English letter translation) and place the individual runes in a paper bag or shoebox.\nOn the drawing paper, create a simple message using the runes that would possibly serve as a source of motivation for students.  (e.g., \"Whoever reads this gets five bonus points.\" or \"Find the treasure for you in the box under the table in the back of the room.\")\nOverlap the paper onto the lower end of the coat hanger and secure it with tape.\n\nProcedure\n\nA week before you begin a unit on the Vikings, hang the runic message in a prominent position in the classroom where each student can easily view it.  (If you really want it to be obvious, use larger paper and colored markers.)  The instructor should defer any questions about the strange markings until he or she is ready to present a lesson on Viking runes.  However, as interest is aroused, have students hypothesize what the symbols may represent.\nWhen the unit on the Vikings begins, tell the class that periodically you will be distributing letter codes that will be useful in decoding the strange message that has been hanging in the classroom for the past week.  Explain that whoever is first to decode the message will be pleasantly surprised.\nLetter translations should be chosen at random by a simple draw from the shoebox or grocery bag.  These individual letter decoders may be given away to individual students who answer a question correctly in class, to any student who completes a homework assignment, to a cooperative team that answers correctly in a review format, or for any other circumstance the classroom teacher wishes to use.\nThe first student to turn in the exact message on a piece of paper to the teacher will be deemed the winner.\n\nBackground\r\nThe Norse alphabet, or Futhark as it was called, was a series of 23 straight-lined symbols the Vikings employed as an alphabet.  They were straight lines because the Vikings carved them into stone or wood, and curved lines would have been difficult.  Viking runes were the source for spells and charms, as well as simple, everyday messages.\r\nViking sagas, or legendary stories, were not written down in this script.  They were oral traditions that only ended up on paper several hundred years after the apex of Viking culture.  When they were written down, they were written in Latin. \nExtension\n\nHave interested students research the Kensington Stone, a stone with apparent runic carvings on it unearthed in Kensington, Minnesota, in 1898.  Its authenticity is the source of great debate among Norse scholars.\nGive students individual copies of the Futhark and have them make simple messages.\n",

Groups should be given a specific time limit to decipher the puzzle, usually no more than five minutes.\r\nSince it is possible that more than one group could solve the rebus in the time allowed, plan a rational method for choosing a team for the original search attempt.  A random draw of team names from a hat could be one method used to break a tie.  A less arbitrary measure would be to allow the first opportunity to solve the rebus to the team that most closely follows a specified set of directions and has completed the solution.\r\nAn alternative would be to move around the classroom garnering the responses from each team within the specified time allotment.  In this situation, the first team to whisper the correct answer to the puzzle would subsequently gain access to the treasure hunt.  The teacher should note successive completion times of other teams should that become necessary in the next step.\r\nThe selected learning group will then have a short period of time (about one minute) to locate the prize.  If the group cannot find the treasure within the minute, the second ranked team would be offered a sixty-second quest.

All possible ideas for solving the dilemma should be presented by team members without censorship.\r\nDuring a subsequent three- to five-minute session, teams should begin to eliminate those solutions with unfavorable consequences for the Ube tribe.  Using general consensus, each team should settle upon what they believe to be their single best solution to share with the class.\r\nEach spokesperson should share his or her team's solution with the class and field questions from classmates and/or the instructor.  Any idea should be accepted if there is evidence of critical thinking in the team's decision-making process.\r\nAfter all teams have shared their suggestions, conduct a discussion regarding the question of what might have caused the extinction of the Ube's yum-yums.  While some students may suggest natural causes for the extinction of the yum-yum trees, others will undoubtedly bring up the point that the tribe over-harvested the trees without regard to eventual consequences.  Make a connection between this observation and similar damage which has occurred in the world's present environment.  Other questions to ask might include, What possible cost did the Ubes face because of an error in conservation?  Are there any lessons in the dilemma of the Ubes that pertain to society today?\r\nNext, discuss the meaning of renewable and non-renewable natural resources.  Give some examples of each to stimulate thought, then have teams or individual students make a list of renewable and/or non-renewable resouces that are the subject of conservation measures in the local, national, or global community.\r\nThis problem-solving activity presents several topics for investigation.  While there are no definite right or wrong answers for this dilemma, certain solutions have more potential than others.  For example, the Ubes may decide that it's better to send small bands of people to obtain yum-yums, or that seeds might be brought back from the excursion instead of entire trees.  However, all student-generated solutions should be considered.  Whatever solutions are generated, be sure to use the activity to discuss not only how geography determines how people live, but how contemporary people have risked their future by showing an uncontrollable appetite for natural resources.",

You may encourage team members to take notes in order to maintain possession of clues throughout the competition.\n\r\nOn the game board, space is provided for checking off each clue given for a river.  When the river is identified, circle the appropriate point value and record the name of the team which first recognized it.

You will read a clue about a famous river, and each team in turn will try to identify its name.\nThere are three levels of play during each game, determined by the degree of difficulty involved in identifying that particular set of rivers by its clues.  The levels are 'Still Water' (easy), 'Swift Current' (average), and 'White Water Rapids' (challenging).  For each level of play, the teacher presents the overhead transparency of the game board with six unknown rivers labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F, corresponding to the labels on the cruise tickets.  There are four clues for each of the six rivers.\nTeams orally choose a clue for any of the six rivers by calling out  a letter A-F.  During the 'Still Water' level of play, a river identified on the first clue given is worth 40 points.  Guessing the name of a river correctly on the second clue garners 30 points; on the third clue, 20 points; and on the fourth clue, 10 points.  The point values change with each level of play.\nNote that tickets for the Still Water Cruise (easy level) have already been provided.  You may wish to prepare additional sets of four clues each for Swift Current (average) and White Water Rapids (challenging) levels.  (Some teachers may involve student teams in researching and developing the clues.)  Simply block out the clues on an existing set of tickets and reproduce blank tickets for the next level of difficulty.  The new clues may be written directly onto the blank tickets.\nPlay continues until all the rivers for a level have been identified, or all clues have been used.  (Note: One, two, or all three levels of play may constitute a game.)  The team with the greatest number of points is the winner.\n",

How did she have time to be a mother, a deputy attorney, assistant attorney general, a state senator, and a judge for 24 years?\r\nFrom the time Sandra was a child living on a ranch in Arizona, she excelled at everything.  She learned how to read by the time she was four, drove a truck at the age of eight, and could ride a horse with the best of them.  Her parents knew that raising a little girl all by herself out in the middle of a huge ranch was going to be a tough job.  When it was time for Sandra to go to school, her parents decided to send her to El Paso, the big city, to live with her grandparents, Mamie and Willis Wiley.  Sandra would never live on the ranch full-time again.  From a private school in El Paso to graduating third in her class at Stanford, Sandra was always an achiever.  She worked very hard to be the best student she could be.\r\nSandra loved ranching and geology and does not remember why she chose law as a career.  She did admit that studying the law kept her busy because there were so many ways of interpreting the law.  While she was in college, she met her future husband, John O'Connor.  After graduation, her husband was offered five positions in law firms, but Sandra could not find a job as an attorney. \r\nNo one wanted a woman.  She was offered a position as a legal secretary.  This roadblock did not stop her.  She soon secured the job of Assistant Deputy County Attorney of San Mateo, California. \r\nSandra was always persistent.  She was a quiet, organized, and efficient woman who never let anything fluster her.  She was in control, no matter what happened to her or around her.  Sandra said that she would prefer practicing law to being a head of state. \r\nSandra Day O'Connor became the first woman associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.  In 1981, during Ronald Reagan's presidency, she succeeded the retiring Justice Potter Stewart.\nSuggested Activities\n\nKnowledge: What kind of education was Sandra given?\nComprehension: Was Sandra always successful?\nCreative Thinking: Why do you think that Sandra wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice?\nApplication: Have you ever thought about being an attorney or running for an office?  For which office would you run?\nAnalysis: Can all women have such spectacular careers and also be good mothers?\nSynthesis: Can anyone become a Supreme Court Justice?\nEvaluation: Is your life similar to Sandra's?  In what ways?  In what ways does it differ?\nAffective: Would you have the energy and resolve to become a Supreme Court Justice?\n\n\nSkills Focus\n\n\nLanguage and Communication Skills: Write a letter to your representative in congress and ask him/her to give you the reasons for becoming a public official.\nIndependent Study Skills: What kinds of courts can be found on the state and national levels?  Describe all of these in their own paragraphs.\nManipulative Skills: Ask an adult to take you horseback riding.\n\n\n\nSocial Studies \n\n\nThe Judicial System:  Encourage students to learn more about the judicial system.  Provide classroom resources or allow library time, if possible, for students to research information on the judicial branch.  Divide the class into groups and provide each group with questions about the judicial system.  Have groups provide feedback on their findings to the class.  As an alternative, divide the class into three groups and assign each group a different branch of the United States government to research.  Each group can prepare a large chart that demonstrates how a particular branch works (similar to the chart on page 105).\n\n\n\nSocial Studies  \n\n\nWomen in Government:  Ask women in the community who hold positions in city or county government to visit your school.   Have students prepare questions to ask them about their achievements and why they chose a career in government.\n\n\n",

Explain to the class, \"I'm going to make a deal with each team today.  The team that follows through on their deal with me will walk away with this goodie bag.\"\nThe \"deal\" is this.  Each team is to discuss what it thinks each member could possibly score on the next chapter or unit test.  Prompt students by pointing out that individual goals should be relatively high but realistically attainable.  The team should then use the Team Goal Contract to list each individual member's name, his or her goal, and the team's subsequent average goal.\nThe teacher is to collect the Team Goal Contract from each team and announce what each team has offered in return for the reward.  It is important to stress that what is offered is not a deal until the goal has actually been met.  The team that meets the highest goal will be rewarded.\nAfter all student questions concerning the deal have been discussed, the teacher will use the offer as an introduction to the Byzantium Empire.  Discuss Constantine's founding of Constantinople and see if students are able to compare his offers (See Background.) to events in our nation's past or present.\nEncourage student teams to form study groups outside of class as much as possible and to use class time to its fullest in order to reach their desired goal.  Remind them that it makes no difference if another team has a higher goal if that group of students doesn't reach it.  Emphasize that team members should encourage each other.  Each individual can control how much effort he or she puts into preparing for the chapter or unit test.\n\nBackground\r\nIn 330 a.d., the Roman emperor Constantine moved his capital out of Rome and into the old Asia Minor city of Byzantium along the Bosporous Strait, which connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara and, ultimately, the Aegean Sea.  He quadrupled the size of old Byzantium and renamed it Constantinople in his honor.  Constantine, who was the first emperor of Rome to embrace Christianity, did build a few churches in his new city.  However, numerous other reasons could be given to explain his abandonment of Rome.  His new location was along established and well-protected trade routes; the eastern half of the Roman Empire was materially better off than the west; Germanic invaders were more prevalent in the west; political intrigue was rampant in Rome.\r\nTo help build his city and give it credibility, Constantine offered inducements for many to follow him to Constantinople.  He offered to build palaces for wealthy patricians if they relocated to Constantinople.  He also offered large tracts of land and annual payments of grain for numerous years to come.\r\nAlthough Constantine's offer met with very limited success, Constantinople grew into an extremely prosperous city, which remained the secure headquarters of the eastern Roman Empire (later named the Byzantine Empire) until its fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.  Noted for a variety of trading enterprises and other businesses, its populace was well educated.  Meanwhile, Rome, having been sacked several times by barbarians in the fifth century a.d., retreated into the backwater of history.\r\nMuch of the United States was settled in a somewhat similar fashion through the Homestead Act of 1862, which opened up vast areas of the Great Plains.  One notable difference is that those that homesteaded the American frontier were usually of a lower economic class who would not normally have been able to afford the land.\r\nIn the present day, however, a different sort of deal is often reported in newspapers nationwide.  Tax abatements are offered by municipal and county governments to lure various industries and their employment opportunities into their communities.  Derided by some as \"corporate welfare\" and praised by others who view the jobs created or saved by such practices as absolutely necessary, tax abatement is somewhat analogous to Constantine's offer of almost two thousand years ago.  Constantine counted upon relocating wealthy Romans to add to the stature and economic stability of his new capital.\nExtensions\n\nHave students research the Homestead Act.  They may write a report or create a display board.  This may be very appropriate if students live in that part of the country where the Homestead Act was the means for settling the frontier.\nStudents may also focus on current events.  Interested students could bring in newspaper articles about local tax abatement issues.  Perhaps informed speakers could offer pro and con arguments on the issue.  Students themselves might be able to research the topic (if it is newsworthy enough in their area) and have a classroom debate on it.\n",

        "Objective": "Students will describe which segments of society were included in the original Athenian democracy.  They will compare and contrast early Greek democracy to democracy as it is exercised in the United States today.",
        "Directions": "Preparation\n\nMake enough copies of the role cards so there is the following ratio: Ecclesia cards should number one-half the male membership of the class.  Metic and servant cards combined should equal one-half the male membership of the class.\nCut out the required number of role cards.  (Cards may be laminated for future use.)\n\nProcedure\n\nInitiate a discussion with the class regarding an upcoming project.  Tell them that you are undecided about what kind of project you want them to do (about any topic you may be currently studying).  Explain that you have thought about a report, a diorama, a play, a mural, etc.  However, you have decided to let democracy rule on this project.\nPass out the needed number of role cards at random to male students only.\nExplain that only those students who possess an Ecclesia card may enter into discussion about the proposed project.\r\n    As deftly as possible, garner responses only from those boys holding an Ecclesia card.  Those boys holding other cards or the girls of the class must be politely, but firmly, told that their opinion in this matter doesn't count.\r\n    Hold a vote on the project choices, allowing only ecclesia members to vote.\n\nFor Discussion\r\nAfter eligible voters have made their decision, the instructor may have to deal with some upset students.  The following questions may help defuse and clarify the lesson succinctly:\n\nHow was or wasn't this a democratic way of dealing with the project dilemma?  (Some students got to vote, but only a minority were able to do so.)\nWhat part of the classroom membership was totally left out of the decision-making process? (the girls)\nWho among the boys were not able to participate in the \"democratic\" process? (those with cards marked \"Servant\" and \"Metic\")\n\n\r\nInform students that this activity simulates the earliest forms of democracy as it was born in Ancient Greece.  Metics, or foreign males, and servants or slaves, as well as women, were denied a part in the governing process.  Only those males age 18 and over whose ancestors had been citizens of Athens were given the right to vote.  Have students compare those qualifications to modern voter qualifications in our country.  \r\n(All citizens--those born in the United States and those legally naturalized--age 18 and older may vote, regardless of race, religion, gender, or political beliefs.)\nBackground\r\nThe idea of democracy was a radical concept for Ancient Greece of 500 B.C.  For over 500 years the Greek city-states had been ruled by oligarchies--small groups of aristocratic men who made all major decisions for the city-state.  The Athenian democratic ideal developed methodically, commencing with the great law-giver, Solon, in 594 B.C. and continuing with a civil official named Cleisthenes.  By the time Pericles became a significant government official in Athens (461 B.C.), all common male citizens whose ancestors had been Athenian citizens were able to direct the course of government.\r\nAt the height of its power, Athens had a population of approximately 200,000 people of whom about 50,000 constituted the male citizenry.  This citizenry met by tribe on a monthly basis to decide issues handed to them by a more exclusive governing assembly.  Large numbers of foreigners and slaves, as well as the women, had no voice whatsoever.  In effect, Western man's initial experiment with democracy was extremely limited, since a minority led the majority.\nFollow-Up\r\nCheck with your local board of elections to see what percent of eligible adults are registered to vote in that area.  Also, ask what percent of eligible voters actually cast ballots in the last election.  In all likelihood, a self-chosen minority of citizens are making decisions for the majority even to this day.\r\nThis could lead to further discussion or an essay for the students, \"The Value of a Vote.\"\r\nThe aforementioned Cleisthenes also introduced the concept of ostracism to the ecclesia.  The citizenry of Athens could deem a particular person as dangerous to the state and, by a majority vote, have that person exiled for 10 years.  If an instructor is open to some controversy and has some advanced students, he or she may pose the question as to what public figure in the United States should be ostracized if it were legal.  The debate could be interesting even if the idea is unconstitutional.",

        "Directions": "Preparation\r\nMake a copy of the dilemma for each student.\nProcedure\n\nHave students grouped in teams of four.  Have one student chosen as a team recorder.\nPass out the copies of the dilemma.  Orally read \"Commander Lear\" to the class.\nHave students within each group take turns listing positive qualities of the main character, Commander Lear.  The recorder should list these qualities.  In a similar manner, have team members take turns listing negative characteristics of Commander Lear.\nFor the remaining questions, have students pair off within each team and discuss them.  After pairs have discussed the questions, they should share their responses with the other pair within the team.\nThe whole class should reconvene, and the teacher should review the items of the dilemma by allowing each team to share either their positive/negative qualities lists or their views on one of the other questions.\nExplain to the class that they will begin learning about a \"civilized\" Ancient Greek city-state that promoted most of the actions presented in \"Commander Lear.\"\n\nBackground\r\nSparta, Athen's perennial nemesis among the Greek city-states, was founded on the idea of military might producing economic right.  Like most city-states on the Greek peninsula, Sparta was unable to support itself solely from the products of the rocky, infertile soil.  However, while most Greeks turned to the sea for trade and commerce, Sparta made the conscious decision to aggressively impose its will on neighboring city-states, subjugating their people into forced labor for the benefit of Sparta.\r\nAs a result, Spartan society developed into three classes.  Spartans were the military faction of society constituting a mere five percent of the people.  The vast majority of the people were traders, artisans, and slaves.  The former enjoyed some freedoms while the latter had virtually none.\r\nA Spartan male left home at age seven to enter into severe military training lasting until he became 20, whereupon he was considered in active service until the age of 60.  While marriage was permitted, no Spartan could live with his wife until the age of 30.\r\nWomen were trained to be good wives of soldiers, and the \"soft\" education of the arts, literature, and philosophy were frowned upon as being unworthy for a warrior.  Newborns were examined shortly after birth.  Any birth defect or hint of infirmity immediately sentenced the infant to death by exposure, and it was left on a mountainside to die.  Imperfect specimens would not be accepted in Spartan society.\r\n\"A Spartan Dilemma\" is designed to be an anticipatory set prior to the class study of this Greek civilization.  If time permits after the study has been completed, the instructor may wish to allow students to make a comparison between the Spartan attitude towards society and Hitler's view of an Aryan \"master race\" in Nazi Germany.  For a more contemporary comparison, these Spartan ideas may be compared to the various supremacist groups that often make the news with their elitist racial diatribes.",

        "Objective": "Students will discuss with their classmates the various reasons for the growth of the Ancient River Civilizations.",
        "Directions": "Egypt is an example of one of the great River Civilizations that appeared in the Middle Eastern region around 3000 B.C.  Others were Persia, Arabia, Syria, Sumer, and Babylon.  Since we have no written records from this time, we are left to speculate as to the reasons why these civilizations appeared at this particular time and in this particular place.  Since proximity to rivers played a large role in the development of these communities, it is important to ask some questions about the influence of the rivers on the development of these ancient civilizations.  Because we do not have written information, we are forced to make theories or hypotheses about how these civilizations were started.\r\nBased upon their knowledge of the ancient cultures, direct students to discuss in small groups which of the following hypotheses would most likely explain the growth of River Civilizations.  They can make their speculations on the activity sheet:  The Growth of River Civilizations.\nHypotheses: \r\n1.The annual flooding deposited a layer of silt, enriching the soil and making it suitable for farming.  This rich soil was able to support large numbers of people in a small area.  Even in dry years the river valley was attractive to people because of the availability of water for irrigation.\r\n2.The growing of wheat and barley was possible because of the reliable water supply.  These grains could be stored for use by towns or villages on the riverbank.  This left leisure-time for other activities, such as building houses.\r\n3.The surplus food supply meant that people could specialize in jobs, such as building, copper smithing, or trading.   In this way, stable villages and towns grew up around these markets and craft centers.  It was no longer necessary for everyone to be involved in hunting or farming.\r\n4.Annual flooding and irrigation required large-scale cooperation and direction.  From this need, larger communities developed.  These groups created leaders and a form of government.  The pharaohs of Egypt probably began as such leaders. \r\n5.Settlements along rivers were more likely to be open to new ideas and techniques from other communities farther along the river.  The river was a highway for the spread of new ideas.\r\n6.A chance invention or discovery (e.g. irrigation wheel, grinding stone) could have dramatically increased food production, thus making larger settlements possible.\nExtended Activities:\r\nHave students compare and create ancient and modern maps of the area of the river civilizations, listing both the old and the new names to connect our study to what is happening in today's news.  Ask students to discuss some of the things that seem to have changed little over the centuries.",

        "Objective": "Students learn about the stock market.",
        "Directions": "Ask students what they know about the stock market, leading them into a discussion of what the stock market is.\r\nThe term stock market refers to the buying and selling of shares, or stock, in all kinds of companies, both in the United States and around the world.  The stock market allows everyone who wishes to participate a chance to own a part of any publicly held company--that is, any company that sells stock to investors.  In this way, the stock market raises capital, or money, that a company can use in order to continue to produce its product or offer its services.  In return for the use of investors' money, if the company does well, investors reap a profit; if the company does poorly, investors see a loss.\r\nHow does the stock market work?  Imagine that there is a company called Hawaiian Plantation that makes all kinds of tropical snack foods you like to eat.  You think it would be fun to have a part of that company--and you can.  You can buy shares of Hawaiian Plantation stock.  As long as the macadamia and pineapple crops are doing well and Hawaiian Plantation is able to generate a profit, the shares that you buy will increase in value.  But if a hurricane hits and most of the pineapple crop is wiped out for a year, Hawaiian Plantation may have to raise its retail prices too high to attract buyers to its product on the supermarket shelf.  Hawaiian Plantation loses money, and you do, too, as investors sell off their stock, and the price of remaining stock plummets.\r\nWhere do you go to buy stock?  Stock is not a product like chocolate-covered macadamia nuts.  Traditionally, stock is purchased from a broker who charges a commission, or fee, for his or her services.  (It is possible to buy stocks online through the Internet without a broker, but a broker also gives recommendations and advice about stocks that a person may want.)  The broker's job is to send a message to the floor broker, who literally walks the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange) when there is a buyer for Hawaiian Plantation stock.  The floor broker actually buys stock from a company that specializes in this type of stock.  \r\nThe floor broker then reports to the broker that the stock was purchased.  The broker reports the trade through computers.  In this way, the rise and fall of stock prices gets reported throughout the business day.  Generally, you would not get the actual stock certificate for your Hawaiian Plantation stock, but the broker keeps your purchase in his or her records.  If you ever want to sell your Hawaiian Plantation stock, you let the broker know, and the process happens in reverse, with the broker charging another commission.  \r\nRemember that thousands and thousands of transactions like this take place, and as a result, millions and millions of dollars change hands on the stock market daily.  The value of stock in various companies can determine the health of the nation's economy.  Far more than Fort Knox, the stock market is at the center of American economic activity.\r\nAsk students the following questions:\r\n1.Why would a company decide not to sell stock?\r\n2.What happens when a stock splits?\r\n3.Would you rather invest in a company that makes a product, such as a food manufacturer, or one that sells a service, such as a hotel chain?  Why?\r\n4.If a company has an unprofitable year, should you as a stockholder automatically sell your stock?  Why or why not?  Can you think of reasons to hold onto a stock over time?\r\nDistribute the activity sheets and have students practice buying and selling stocks.",

        "Directions": "Background \r\nThe idea that moral constitution, not material wealth, dictated eternal happiness started in Egypt about four thousand years ago.  Its origin is in the legend of Osiris, one of the sons of Ra, who was killed and dismembered by his evil brother, Seth.  Osiris's wife, Isis, gathered the various parts of Osiris' body, and he came back to life to serve as the god of the dead.  He would determine the worthiness of any dead person by placing the person's heart on a balance offset with the weight of a feather.  If the heart was light and good, it would balance, and the person would be welcomed into eternity.  A heart maligant with wickedness would easily tip the scales, and that person would be thrown to a voracious monster to be devoured.\nPreparation\r\nMake an overhead transparency of the Osiris picture.\r\nMake copies of the Osiris picture equal to the number of student teams within the class.\r\nCut each copy of Osiris into approximately 20-24 irregularly shaped pieces.  (Each may be cut separately, or several copies may be cut together to expedite the process.)\r\nPlace pieces for each copy into separate plastic bags.\nProcedure\r\nAsk the students if they understand the concept of immortality or eternal life.  Allow some discussion of their ideas of eternity.\r\nPass out the Osiris puzzle bags to each team.\r\nInstruct students that they will unlock the key to the Ancient Egyptians' view of immortality as they work the puzzle in front of them.  Project the image of Osiris on the overhead.\r\nAllow student teams time to complete their respective puzzles.\r\nAfter groups have successfully completed their puzzles, share the importance of Osiris' legend with the students (See background information above.)  Have students compare the Egyptian version of eternity with that of the Ancient Mesopotamians.  Which one would be more favorable?  (The Egyptians had a much more positive view of eternity than the Mesopotamians.)\nFollow-Up\r\nHave students compile a list of values or virtues that they think are important.  These lists may be developed and discussed in teams and/or whole class sessions.\r\nThe teacher may want to ask students to write a descriptive paper on what they perceive eternal life to be.  They may cite religious beliefs or other references for their particular conceptions.",

Facilitate a short discussion about the items and how they are related.  Next, tell students they are about to embark on a journey where they will learn about advertising techniques, they will become more informed consumers, and they will use what they have learned to create and market a product that might make them rich and famous one day.  Explain that in order to do this, they will need to be able to research and find information.  Hand out the Consumerism Scavenger Hunt and the Internet Research Guidelines.  Go over the directions on both with the group.  Next, give students 1-2 minutes to find, or you can assign, scavenger hunt partners.  Tell students that the group who has the most correct answers will receive some sort of prize.  Give students the remainder of the class period to find as much information as possible using the Internet (preferably a lab setting).

These beautiful phenomena appear as thin veils of colored light, usually green, moving silently across the sky.  Today, we know they result from disturbances in the magnetic field surrounding Earth (geomagnetic field).  The disturbances are caused by interaction with the solar wind, a continuous flow of electrically charged particles from the sun.  When there are many sunspots on the sun, increased particles are released and, thus, there is a brighter aurora.  The aurora is usually visible only from latitudes near the geomagnetic poles but may be seen nearer the equator during times of peak sunspot activity.  The aurora occurs in the upper atmosphere, usually 60-620 miles (97-1,000 km) above Earth.\nClassroom Activity\nUse the transparency Earth's Magnetic Tail to review information learned in the previous lesson.\nShow the students pictures of aurora of Jupiter and Saturn.\nVisit the Web site below as an introduction to the students.  Explain that when people first saw these beautiful displays in the sky, they were afraid.  Not knowing what caused them, they made up stories to explain these phenomena.  Tour the spectacular photos and read the information on pages 1-4.

Mark a copy of the Hurricane Map with the locations of the complete data to create an answer sheet.\nActivity\r\nTell the students that it is September 3 at 6:00 a.m. and information about a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas has just been received.  The hurricane has been named Sam.  Place the map transparency on the overhead.  Find the coordinates for Hurricane Sam (20° N 64° W) and then, stick a dot on this location.  Show the students how to find the coordinates as you do so.  Put the transparency of the hurricane shape over the dot so that its center is over the dot.  Let the students know that at this point, it has been decided that a hurricane warning and evacuation order will be sent to both the Bahamas and Dominican Republic. Show where these are located on the map.\r\nExplain to the students that they are going to be meteorologists working at a hurricane center and following the progress of Hurricane Sam.  Divide the students into six groups and provide each group a copy of the map, data pages, and six adhesive dots.   Have them read the data and see that it is updated every 12 hours.  Tell them to use the technique you showed them and plot the progress of the hurricane on their maps.  Tell them to mark each new data on the map in pencil first and then, place the dot over it.  Monitor the groups at first to be sure they understand what to do and are sharing the responsibilities.\r\nBecause students mark the new location each time, they should decide what action they will take such as, order evacuations or give only warnings.  Discuss with them the consequences of giving evacuation orders as opposed to warnings.\nClosure\r\nAs the students work, plot the seven hurricane locations on the transparency, using the answer map prepared earlier.  Discuss their answers for the warnings they gave as the hurricane progressed.  These will vary with the groups.  Lead the students in a final analysis of the hurricane warnings they gave.  Help them understand how difficult this is in real life situations.",

        "Directions": "Follow the instructions to assemble the transparencies of the orbits of Earth and a comet.  Place this on an overhead projector and have students look at the comet in the various locations of its orbit around the sun.  Discuss what they see happening to the comet from positions 1-9.  (The tail forms and lengthens as it nears the sun, and then diminishes as it moves away from the sun.  The tail always points away from the sun.)\r\nRotate Earth's orbit disk until the planet is at the #1 position.  Draw a line with a wet-erase pen from Earth to the comet in the #1 position and another from Earth to the sun.  Have students tell what the comet would look like from Earth at this time.  (There is no tail; since the comet is far from the Earth, it would appear very dim and small.) Ask them where it would appear in the sky relative to the sun.  (It would be about 45 degrees from the sun.) Erase the lines.\r\nMove Earth to #2 and draw the lines again.  Distribute drawing paper to students and have them draw what the comet would look like from Earth, showing the comet and the sun.  (The comet would have a short tail, difficult to see since Earth's view would be nearly straight at the coma.  The comet would be somewhat closer to the sun.)\r\nMove Earth to #3 and have the students add the new picture of the comet to their drawing.  (The comet's tail will be longer, and it will be closer to the sun.)\r\nContinue moving Earth to each position and have students make drawings to show what they would see.  (The comet would disappear in the glare of the sun at #5.)\r\nAdd the dates to the comet positions on the transparency and have the students place them on their drawings as well, beginning at #2.  (1) May 15, (2) July 1, (3) August 1, (4) August 25, (5) September 1, (6) September 8, (7) October 2, (8) November 1, (9) December 18\r\nAsk students to look at the comet's motion and explain it.  (The comet moves slowly from #1 to #3, speeds up between #4 and #6, and then slows down again.  As the comet is pulled toward the sun, it slowly adds speed and then moves fastest when close to the sun, slowing down again, once it begins to travel away from the sun.)\r\nPlace an X on one of the places where the comet crosses through Earth's orbit.  Explain that a comet's orbit is usually not in the same plane as Earth's orbit but may come in at an angle so that it actually crosses the orbit at only one point.  Ask students what happens to the comet as its core heats up when it gets close to the sun.  (It loses dirt from its core.)\r\nExplain that this dirt becomes trapped in Earth's orbit here.  Rotate Earth to that spot and ask what happens when Earth returns to this part of its orbit again.  (Earth's gravity pulls some pieces into its atmosphere.  We see these as meteors.)\nThe Visual Dictionary of the Universe and The Young Astronomer have lists of some of the famous comets and their periods (length of time for one trip around the sun).  Show the students that some of these will be visible in their lifetime; however, remind them that there will also be new comets appearing as well.",

        "Directions": "Tell students that many mountains in countries like Japan are actually active volcanoes.  Scientists in Japan study many aspects of their volcanoes, including lava viscosity.  Viscosity is the internal friction of a liqud, or its ability to run fast or slow.  Water is a liquid with low viscosity, and so it runs freely.  Liquids such as honey and maple syrup both have high viscosity, making them thick and slow moving.  By studying the viscosity of lava, scientists can determine how dangerous an active volcano might be.  It is the amount of silica in the lava that determines its viscosity.  A volcano with small amounts of silica has a low viscosity.  It is swift moving and able to destroy surrounding areas quickly without much time for evacuation.  The more silica in the lava, the thicker and slower it flows.<br />\r\nBy studying the lava viscosity, scientists can also determine the type of volcano that will be formed.  For example, the lava from Mount St. Helens is highly viscous, and so the slow-moving lava created a steep-sided volcano.  On the other hand, the lava found in the Hawaiian Islands is thin and swift moving, creating flat volcanoes.<br />\r\nHave students try the following experiment:<br />\r\nGather four clear household liquids with a variety of viscosity.<br />\r\nPour the same amount of each liquid into four tall, clear beakers or graduated cylinders.  Label the beakers A, B, C, and D.  Imagine the four cylinders are lava taken from four different volcanoes in Japan.  It is your job as the scientist to test the lava viscosity and report to the public the dangers posed by each volcano.<br />\r\nUse a stopwatch and four marbles to test the viscosity of the lave and record your findings on the activity sheet.  Begin with sample A.  Describe the liquid and then time how long it takes for a marble to drop through the liquid to the bottom of the container.  Record your findings on the chart.  Based on the speed of the marble, predict the amount of silica in this lava sample and record your prediction on the chart by placing an X along the scale and drawing a picture of the volcano that would be formed.<br />\r\nContinue this procedure with the three other lava samples.  Then make a report to the people living in the areas around each of the volcanoes.  What kind of warning would each receive?",

        "Directions": "Facts to Know\r\nWhen money is borrowed, you must pay to use it because someone else is losing an opportunity to use it while you have it.  What you pay to use the money is called interest.  The rate of interest is a percent.  The money you borrow is called the principal.  Simple interest is paid only on the principal.\r\nThe Interest Formula\r\nTo calculate the amount of simple interest on a loan, use this formula:\r\nInterest = Principal x Rate of Interest x Time (or) I = PRT\r\nRate of Interest \r\nThe rate of interest is always given as a percent.  You often see rates of interest on loans and investments posted outside of banks.\r\nTime\r\nTime in connection with loans is always expressed in years or parts of a year.\r\n1 month =  1/12 of a year\r\n6 months =  6/12  or  1/2 year\r\nCalculating Interest\r\nTo find simple interest, use the formula I = PRT\r\nSample:  How much would a loan of $500 be at 6% interest for 6 months?\r\nStep 1  Use the interest formula.  The formula to calculate interest is this:\r\nInterest = Principal x Rate of Interest x Time (I = P x R x T)\r\nStep 2  Change the rate, given as a percent, to a fraction and reduce.  Set up time as a fraction of a year.\r\nR =   6/100  =   3/50\r\nT =  6/12  = 1/2\r\nStep 3  Multiply principal x rate x time.  Cancel where possible.\r\nI = 500/1   x   3/50  x  1/2  =  $15\r\nor, after cancelling, I = 5/I x 3/1 x 1/1=$15\r\nYou can also change the percent to a decimal (6% = .06) and the time to a decimal \r\n(6 months =  6/12 = .5) and then multiply.\r\nI = $500.00 x .06 x .5 = $15\r\nSample:  A T-shirt costs $24.99 and a pair of jeans costs $34.99.  Each is on sale for 25% off the original price.  If Jenna bought the T-shirt and jeans while they were on sale, what was her total price before adding tax?  What is the total amount that Jenna had to pay for her purchase after tax was added?  (Tax is 8%.)\n$24.99 original T-shirt pricex 0.25 discount------$6.2475 = $6.25 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)$24.99-$6.25------$18.74 sale price for T-shirt$34.99 original jeans pricex 0.25 discount------$8.7475 = $8.75 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)$34.99-$8.75------$26.24 sale price for jeans\n\r\nJenna paid $18.74 + $26.24 = $44.98 for the T-shirt and jeans.\r\nDiscounts and Sales\r\nA discount is used by manufacturers and merchants to mean taking off a certain percentage of the price given in a price list.  This price is called the list price.  The list price less the discount is known as the net price.  The noun \"discount\" can be used as a verb, too--\"We're discounting by 15% the list price on all new cars and trucks during our storewide 'Get into Spring' sale!\"\r\nYou would ask \"What's the discount?\" but not, \"What's the sale?\"  Often you have to figure out your own savings during a sale, and this is where understanding decimals and percents comes in handy.\r\nLet's say, for instance, you read that a local amusement park is offering a single, one-day pass to all rides for $12.50, or a special two-day pass for $20.00.  You do some quick decimal arithmetic.\n$12.50 one-day passx    2------$25.00 So your savings on a two day pass is the following: $25.00 one-day pass-$20.00 two-day pass-------- $5.00But, just curious--what percent off is that?$ 5.00    n                          $ 5.00   100   500------ = --- --> invert and multiply ------ x --- = ---  or 20% off$25.00   100                         $25.00    n    25",

Let them talk about it or tell them yourself that the Iditarod is a race of over 1,000 miles that mushers and their dogs run in Alaska.  Tell them that they will learn about this race in this exploration, and they will have an opportunity to work with data from the race.\nActivity 1:  Prize Money\r\nHave students use the website listed below to answer the following questions.  How much more does the first place winner make than the last place winner?  Express your answer in dollars, and then show the increase as a percentage.  You may need to review with your students how to calculate the percentage increase.\nActivity 2:  The Red Lantern Musher\r\nHave students find the most recent race that has data on the finishing time of the winner and the finishing time of the last place finisher, also known as the Red Lantern Musher.  They should calculate their rates of travel in miles per day to the nearest hundredth.  What is the difference in their rate of travel?  You may need to review with students how to calculate a rate.\nActivity 3:  Winning Rates\r\nHave students complete the following activities. You may need to review with your students how to calculate a rate.  The equation should be in the form t = d / r (where t = time, d = distance, and r = rate).\r\nFind the times of the winner in 1973 and the most recent winner.  Calculate their rates of travel in miles per day to the nearest hundredth.  What is the difference in their rate of travel?\r\nImagine that the most recent winner can always run his or her dogs at the same rates no matter what the distance.  Write an equation that shows how to calculate the time to run a given distance. \r\nImagine that the most recent winner ran his or her dogs for a distance of 1,300 miles at the rate you calculated in Part A.  Use the equation you wrote in Part B to calculate how much time it would take to go 1,300 miles.\nActivity 4:  A Sample of Mushers\r\nHave students complete the following activities. You may need to review the topic of probability with your students.  Help them understand that if their sample size was 10 and five out of the 10 mushers were between the ages of 40 and 49, then the probability of a musher being 40 to 49 in age is 5/10 or 1/2.  Discuss the results with your students.  If they came fairly close in the predictions they should feel successful in their ability to predict based on looking at a sample.\r\nLook at the page that names the mushers.  You are going to try to predict the age of a musher.  First, you will look at the ages of many mushers.  How many mushers and their ages do you think you should look at in order to make an accurate prediction?  Once you decide how many mushers you need age information on (sample size), click on that number of mushers to collect the age data.  Use the chart on the work sheet to assign probabilities various age categories.\r\nMake a prediction on the ages of a randomly selected group of 10 mushers.  Use the probabilities you created in Part A.\r\nSelect 10 mushers that you did not select in Part A.  Collect the data on their ages.  How accurate was the prediction you made in Part B?",

How many centimeters are there in four inches?\r\nYou must multiply the number of centimeters in one inch by four.\r\nStep 1  Line up the numbers for easy multiplication.  You don't need to line up the decimal points, however.\r\nStep 2  Multiply the numbers as you would multiply whole numbers.\r\nStep 3  Count the number of decimal places in both numbers that you multiplied.  Make sure the decimal places in the product equal the number of decimal places in the problem.\n\n\n\n 2.54   \n (2 decimal places)   \n\n\n x 4   \n (0 decimal places)   \n\n\n ____   \n \n\n\n 10.16   \n (2 decimal places)   \n\n\n\n\r\nSo the final answer is 10.16 cm",

The number 12 is the first abundant number.\r\nThere are only 21 abundant numbers between 12 and 100.\n\nDefective (Deficient) Numbers\nDefective numbers are those numbers in which the sum of the proper factors is less than the number itself.  Defective numbers are sometimes called deficient numbers.\nSample\r\nThe proper factors of 22 are 1, 2, and 11.  Add 1 + 2 + 11.  The sum, 14, is less than 22 and 22 is, therefore, defective.\r\nMost numbers are defective because they have very few factors.  All prime numbers are defective.\r\nDistribute the activity sheets and have students use the concepts they have learned to complete the activity.",

The length is 3.5 centimeters and the width is 2.4 centimeters.\r\nAdd the 3.5 plus 2.4, which equals 5.9 centimeters.  \r\nMultiply by 2 to get the other two sides of the rectangle.  \r\nThe total perimeter is 11.8 centimeters.\nPerimeters of Other Polygons\n\n\r\nAdd the sides of each polygon to compute the perimeter.\r\n6.3 cm + 6.3 cm + 4.5 cm = 17.1 cm   7.3 cm x 5 = 36.5 cm\r\nCircumference of a Circle\nThe formula for determining the circumference of a circle is 2πr or πd.  (To solve, multiply 2 times r (the radius) times π (equals to approximately 3.14) or multiply d (the diameter) times 3.14.\r\nMultiply 5 times 2 times 3.14 or\r\n5 x 2 x 3.14 = 31.4 m, so C = 31.4 meters\n",

(before Christ).  Some books use b.c.e. (before the common era).  This time record counts backwards from the approximate date of Christ's birth until the earliest dates in recorded history.  The bigger the number named with b.c. or b.c.e., the further back in time the event occurred.  Numerical dates in b.c. become smaller as they approach the present so 44 b.c. is much closer to the present than 3500 b.c.

(anno Domini) dates events from the approximate time of the birth of Christ.  Anno Domini is a Latin expression meaning \"in the year of Our Lord.\"  The year 2000 a.d. is about 2,000 years since the birth of Christ.  The abbreviation c.e. (common era) means exactly the same time as a.d.  The year 2000 can be written as 2000 a.d. or 2000 c.e.  Some books use c.e. and others use a.d.  Numerical dates in a.d.

        "Directions": "Many basic word problems can be expressed in an equation format, which makes it easy to understand and solve.\nUsing Algebraic Symbols\r\nYou can use a letter of the alphabet to represent the unknown number in a problem.  The equation is written so that the values on the left side of the equal sign equal the values on the right side of the equal sign.  Solve the equation so that the unknown value represented by a letter is alone on one side of the equal sign and the value of the unknown is on the other side of the equal sign.\nSample:  Jennifer has $25.00. She needs $49.00 to buy a new school outfit. How much more money does she need?  Write an equation this way:  n>/i> (money needed) + 25 (money she has) = 49 (cost of outfit);  Solve the equation by subtracting 25 from each side.  Jennifer needs $24.00 more.\r\nn + 25 = 49\r\nn + 25 - 25 = 49 - 25\r\nn = 24\nAxiom of Equality\r\nThe axioms of equality were used to help solve the basic equation above.  Any value added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided to one side of the equal sign must be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided respectively to the other side.\nSample:  A group of 5 girls decided to split evenly the $18.75 cost of a CD album by their favorite group.  How much money did each girl spend?  Write an equation.  Solve for n (the amount each girl spent) by dividing each side of the equation by 5.  Each girl spent $3.75.\r\n5n  = $18.75\r\n5n / 5 = $18.75 / 5\r\nn = $3.75\nWorking with Two Unknown Quantities\r\nYou can use the same letter with an added or subtracted amount to represent two unknown quantities. Simplify and combine terms whenever possible. \nSample:  Sammy's mother is 2 years more than 3 times as old as Sammy.  Their combined age is 42.  How old are Sammy's mother and Sammy?  Write an equation where n equals Sammy's age.  Let 3n + 2 = Sammy's mother's age.  Since the total of their ages equals 42, then n + 3n + 2 = 42;  Then combine the terms:  4n + 2 = 42;  Use the axioms of equality by subtracting 2 and then dividing by 4. Sammy is 10 years old. His mother is 32 years old.\r\n4n + 2  = 42 \r\n4n + 2 - 2  =  42 - 2 \r\n4n  = 40 \r\n4n / 4  =  40 / 4\r\nn  = 10",

The formula for finding the perimeter of rectangles and other parallelograms is P = (l + w) x 2  or  P = 2 l + 2 w\nArea\r\nThe area of a flat surface is a measure of how much space is covered by that surface.  Area is measured in square units.  \nArea of a Rectangle\r\nThe area of a rectangle is computed by multiplying the width of one side times the length of the adjoining side (A = l x w). The area of a rectangle can also be determined by multiplying the base times the height (A = b x h).\nArea of a Triangle\r\nA triangle is always one half of a rectangle or a parallelogram.  The area of a triangle is computed by multiplying 1/2 of the base times the height of a triangle (A = 1-2 b x h)\nArea of a Parallelogram\r\nThe area of a parallelogram is computed by multiplying the base times the height (A = b x h).\nArea of a Circle\r\nTo find the area of a circle, multiply π (3.14) times the radius times the radius again (A = π r2).\nCircumference \r\nThe circumference is the distance around a circle.  To find the circumference of a circle, multiply π (which always equals 3.14) times the diameter or multiply 2 times π (3.14) times the radius (C = π d  or  C = 2 π r).\nVolume\r\nThe formula for finding the volume of a rectangular prism, such as a box, is to multiply the length times the width times the height   (V = l x w x h).  \r\nThe formula for finding the volume of a cylinder is to multiply π (3.14) times the radius squared times the height  (V = π x r2 x h ).\r\nVolume is always computed in cubic units.

        "Directions": "Introduce to students the following information about algebraic expressions.\r\nFacts to Know\r\nAlgebra is a branch of mathematics that uses numbers and letters that stand for numbers to solve problems.  In algebra, if a number is unknown, any letter of the alphabet can be used to stand for that number.  Letters are called variables because the values of the letters vary from one problem to another.  In one problem, x may stand for -2.  In another problem, it may stand for 43.\r\nWriting Algebraic Expressions\r\nAn algebraic expression is a statement made up of numbers, variables, and signs of operation \r\n(+, -, ÷, x).  The phrase \"a number\" indicates the use of the variable.\n\r\nCombining Like Terms\r\nSometimes algebraic expressions can be shortened by combining like terms making them simpler to understand.  An expression is made up of smaller parts called terms.  A term can be made up of numbers, variables, or numbers and variables.  In an expression, terms are separated by only plus and minus signs.\r\nExamples: 15, x, xy, 5xy, 4x/y\r\nA numerical coefficient is any number in front of a variable in a term. If there is no number in front of a varible, the numerical coefficient is understood to be 1.\n\r\nAn exponent tells how many times a number has been multiplied by itself.  Examples: 42, 8w3, 10n3\r\nTerms that have all of the same variables (xy, 3xy, 5xy, etc.) or variables with the same exponents (4a2 + a2), are called like or similar terms.  Like terms can be combined by combining the numerical coefficients.\n\r\nBut an algebraic expression like  9y2 + 2y cannot be combined because y2 and 2y are not like terms.  One has an exponent of 2 and the other has a coefficient of 2.\r\nEvaluating Algebraic Expressions\r\nRemember that in algebra a variable can stand for any number.  However, sometimes in an algebraic expression, you are given the value of the letter.  Then you must replace the variables with the numbers they represent to solve for the value of the whole expression.\n\r\nDistribute the activity sheets and have students complete the activity.",

        "Directions": "Discuss with students the fact that living things need food in order to survive.  A food chain shows how living things need each other for food.  A green plant is usually found at the bottom of a food chain.  The plant uses energy from the sun to carry on a process called photosynthesis.  This allows the plant to produce its own food.  As a result, the plant in a food chain is called a producer.\r\nThe producer, or plant, is eaten by an animal that is a herbivore, which is an animal that eats only plants, or an omnivore, which is an animal that eats plants and other animals.  On the food chain, the animal that eats the producer is called a consumer.  This is because it consumes the producer.\r\nIn the next part of a food chain, the consumer is eaten by another animal that is a carnivore, which is an animal that eats only meat, or an omnivore.  This animal is also called a consumer.\r\nHere is an example of a food chain.  Notice that the arrows start with the producer and point toward the consumers.\r\nProducer --> Consumer --> Consumer\r\n(Grass) --> (Grasshopper) --> (Bird)\r\nThere are many food chains living in a community.  Some are very simple, while others are more complex.  Since most animals eat more than one type of food, they might have several different food chains that can be made.  When food chains connect or overlap, it is called a food web.  If one part of the food web becomes extinct, the entire web may be affected, causing drastic consequences.\r\nWrite these examples of food webs on the board:\r\nSnowy Owl --> Lemming --> Plants\r\nSnowy Owl --> Arctic Hare --> Plants\r\nSnowy Owl --> Ground Squirrel --> Plants\r\nAsk students if they can create a food web that begins with humans.  Have them write some possible webs on the board.  Discuss what we are dependant on in order to survive.\r\nDistribute copies of the Arctic Food Web activity sheet to students.

You have all their answers.  Fill in the blanks or answer the questions on the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) sheet.\r\nThe questions on the FAQ sheet (page 30) follow the article exactly.\nActivity 2-A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words\r\nYou know the phrase a picture is worth a thousand words.  Create a poster to help increase the holiday sales of bottled light.  On your poster show:\n\nWhat will your bottled light look like?\nWhere could it be useful?\nHow long does the light last?\nHow much will it cost?\n\nActivity 3- The One-Minute Approach \r\nWith the installation of a new phone system in your office, you find that you are making a lot more phone calls trying to sell your bottled light.  It's finally time to fine-tune your one-minute phone call sales pitch.  Write a one-minute sales pitch to sell your bottled light over the phone.\nActivity 4-Phone Follow-Up Demonstrations\r\nMore and more people are asking for demonstrations of light and what colors are in your bottled light.  Obtain a prism and a light from your teacher.  Use the prism to separate the light into its primary colors.\n\nList all the colors you think you should see from your light.\nList all the colors you actually see from your light.\nWhich colors are not in your light but you thought should be there?  Why are they not there?\nWhich colors are the brightest? \n\nActivity 5-Resolving Concerns\r\nA Siberian tanning salon is investigating a new light source.

Radio waves traveling at the speed of light can be sent and received by radio telescopes.  Earthbound scientists sent a message from Earth in 1974 via a gigantic radio telescope located in Puerto Rico.  They also use radio telescopes to listen for any radio waves which may be sent by intelligent life.  Thus far, no messages have been received.  Even at the speed of light, these messages need to travel thousands of years to reach their destinations.\r\nAnother way of communicating to these distant locations is to attach messages in the form of pictures and sound to satellites launched to outlying planets in our solar system.  Such messages have been sent aboard the Voyagers 1 and 2 and Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft that went to the outer planets.

        "Directions": "Have two students come to the front of the room and play musical chairs with one chair.  Ask the class what happened when they both tried to take up the same space at the same time.\r\nHave a team come up to form a liquid molecule shape (standing slightly apart, holding hands).  Have another team come up and huddle like a solid molecule shape.  Ask them to enter the \"liquid\" molecule team.  The liquid molecules will have to spread apart to let them in.\r\nRemind students that one of the two things which are true for all kinds of matter is that matter takes up space.  They just saw that when two students try to take up the same space at the same time, one of them has to leave.\r\nToday they will do an experiment in which they investigate what happens when two kinds of matter try to take up the same space at the same time.  In this experiment, they will need to carefully measure, using both a measuring cup and a ruler.\r\nReview measuring procedures, pointing out that when using a measuring cup they must first be certain that they are using the correct measuring cup, then, that the cup is filled to the top.  If they spill what is in the cup they will need to remeasure.\r\nDemonstrate setting the #1 cm end of a ruler on the table next to a cup and reading the measurement next to a line on the cup.\r\nDiscuss and demonstrate that to determine how much space matter took up, they will need to first measure the water in a cup before any matter is added, then measure the water after the matter is added.  They will then need to subtract the first measurement from the second in order to see how much space was taken up.\r\nHave students use the following procedure to complete the experiment.\n\nDiscuss the question.  Thinking about what you have observed around you and learned in class, make a team hypothesis.  Write it on your experiment sheet.\nFollow the procedure steps on your experiment sheet.  Be certain to check off each step as you do it.  Complete your data-capture sheet as you work.\nWrite the results of your experiment, telling what you actually saw happening.  Talk about the materials you used in the experiment.\nDiscuss the conclusion.  Remember that you are trying to answer the experiment question.  Be sure that you have a because statement in the conclusion, and talk about the molecules.\n\nExtensions\n\nHave students do a Writing to Inform exercise.  Ask them to explain to a student in another class what they did in this experiment, using sequence words, and tell what they discovered.\nPut a hole in the bottom of a large empty juice can.  Place the can upside down in a bucket of water, having students place their hands near the hole.  As water enters the can, they will feel air rushing out of the can.  As the water enters the space inside the can, it pushes the air which was there out, since they both cannot take up the same space at the same time.\nTry two short experiments to show that ice takes up more space than water:  1) Fill a bottle to the top with water and make a loose fitting cap out of aluminum foil.  Put the bottle in the freezer until the contents are frozen.  The ice will expand, pushing the top off.  The molecules in ice have a different configuration than the molecules in water.  2) Float an ice cube in a glass of water that is almost full.  Have students watch what happens to the water line as the ice melts.\n\n\nClosure\n\nDiscuss the experiment hypotheses, results, and conclusions.  Examine the team charts to make certain that all the teams got the same measurements for the first step of each part of the experiment.  Everyone should have the same cm measurement for 1/2 cup (125 mL) of water, every time.  The experiment results will be affected if the measurements weren't properly taken.\nDiscuss the fact that the solids and liquids were carefully measured, but there was no way to carefully measure gas, so that the experiment cannot fully compare a gas with the liquid and solid.\nHave students make a science journal entry: \"Two kinds of matter cannot stay in the same space at the same time.\"\n",

        "Directions": "Background\r\nScientists have gathered evidence which shows that the Earth's crust is broken into sections, much like the cracked shell of a hard-boiled egg.  The crust is actually very thin compared to the rest of the Earth.  If the shell were removed from the hard-boiled egg and the egg sprayed with paint, the thin layer of the paint would closely resemble the depth of the crust relative to the internal sections of the planet.\r\nWhen equipment made it possible to map the ocean floor and dive to the great depths, another world opened to scientists.  High ridges and deep trenches were discovered on the ocean floor.  Molten lava was seen pouring from cracks in the ocean floor.  This added to the knowledge of the Earth's crust and helped support the theory of Continental Drift.  The crust is constantly being recycled as new, molten material rises through cracks and pushes aside old material before solidifying.\r\nEdges of some of the crustal plates are diving beneath others, creating earthquakes and volcanic activity.  An example of this is the Pacific Plate.  The collision of these plates also causes uplifting of mountain ranges.  This can be seen along the western edge of South America as the Nazca Plate pushes under the South America Plate, lifting up the Andes Mountain range along the coastline.\r\nAs a plate dives beneath another, it begins to melt down when it comes in contact with the hotter mantle lying under the crust.  The result of all this is the slow but continuous recycling of the Earth's crust, continents relocating, and mountains rising.\nPreparation\n\nMake copies of Earth's Plates Puzzle and cut the pieces apart.  Put the pieces for each puzzle in a separate envelope.  Make a transparency of this page and cut them apart.\nHard-boil an egg, crack the shell in several places, and then outline the edges of these cracks with permanent black-felt pen.\nDisplay the maps in the classroom.\n\n\nProcedure\n\nShow the students the hard-boiled egg with the cracked shell.

        "Objective": "Students will plot the path of Mars through the constellations.",
        "Directions": "Background\r\nAncient astronomers (astrologers) mapped the positions of planets moving gradually through zodiac constellations.  They saw that planets moved across the sky from east to west each day.  However, they also slipped eastward throughout the year.  Since astronomers believed the planets were traveling around Earth, they assumed the paths would always move eastward, like the sun.  What they observed was very different.  The planets did move eastward, but from time to time they would slow down, stop, and then begin moving westward.  Gradually, they would slow down again until they stopped and resumed their eastward motion again.  Thus, they appeared to be making loops in their paths.  The loops varied in size with each planet, and not every planet was looping at the same time.  This was finally explained by the theory that the planets were traveling around Earth within their own circular orbits, called epicycles.  Later, it was proved that the planets revolve around the sun, not Earth.  Now, a different explanation for this backwards, or retrograde, motion was needed.  \r\nMars will be used as the example in this activity to show students what the retrograde loop looks like when plotted against the constellations and why we see this happening.\n\nMake transparencies of Mars Motion in 1971 and Explaining Retrograde Motion.  Cut and assemble the latter according to the instructions.\nShow the transparency of Mars Motion in 1971.  Read the information about the diagram.\nHave students refer to drawing and chart to answer the following questions:\n\n\n\n(Trace the path of Mars from #1 to #13.) Look at the path.  What is the direction of Mars from #1 position to #4? (eastward)\nDescribe what happened after that.  (The planet began to move westward after #5 until #9 when it began to move eastward again.)\nWas there any change in Mars' appearance at this time? (Yes, it increased in size from #1 to its largest size on August 11 at position #7.  It then began to become smaller)\nWhat happened to its brightness? (Mars became brighter as it grew in size and then dimmer as it reduced in size.)\nWhy would Mars change in size and brightness? (As it gets closer to Earth, it would appear to increase in size and brightness.)\n\n\nShow the students the transparency of Explaining Retrograde Motion of Mars.  Point out the orbits of Mars and Earth are not centered on the sun.  Show that Mars takes longer than 12 months to make one complete trip around the sun.  Place a finger from each hand on the position 1 for both planets.  Rotate Earth's orbit, keeping your fingers moving to 2.  As you do this for all positions, pause to analyze the distances and direction of Mars.  Notice that Mars appears to lag behind Earth (retrograde) from 4 until 10, after which Mars begins to catch up with Earth again.  \nHave the students find where Mars appears brightest (4 or 5).  Dimmest (12).\n",

        "Objective": "Students will learn about constellations and how we can see them from Earth.",
        "Directions": "Constellation Activities\r\n(The Young Astronomer, pages 25-30); (The Visual Dictionary of the Universe, pages 15-17)  Several activities in The Young Astronomer help students study the night sky. These include making a quadrant or simple sextant to determine latitude (page 27) and a device to show the positions of the sun, Earth, and zodiac constellations (pages 28 and 29). There is also an activity for creating a model of the constellation Cygnus (the Swan or Northern Cross) on page 30. Both books have excellent constellation maps.\nBackground\r\nConstellations (pages 61 and 62) are images of human and animal figures in the sky, using stars like dot-to-dot pictures. Most of these were designed over 2,000 years ago, spread symmetrically around a point above Earth's North Pole. Today Polaris (the North Star) is over the Pole, but that was not so then. As Earth rotates on its axis, it wobbles like a top so that the north axis pole moves in a circular motion over a 26,000-year period. This changes the locations of constellations.\r\nThe 12 zodiac constellations are located along the ecliptic, the path the sun appears to follow as Earth revolves around it. The moon and planets also follow this path and are seen against the band of zodiac constellations. Astronomy had its beginnings in astrology, a belief that human behavior was controlled by the motion of the planets, sun, and moon within zodiac constellations. We know now that there is no connection between how these celestial bodies move and what happens to anyone on Earth. But astrologers carefully recorded the changing locations of these bodies, and this valuable data later helped astronomers understand more about the motions of planets.\r\nThe sun's position within zodiac constellations is different today. Along with the wobble of Earth, the planet does not return to exactly the same location in its orbit at the same time each year. Thus, the sun gradually moves into the next zodiac constellation. The months when the sun is in each zodiac constellation (pages 61 and 62) do not match the dates in horoscopes, but are astronomically correct for the present time.\r\nThe zodiac and other constellations serve as useful maps of the sky, helping us locate planets, comets, and other celestial bodies. Monthly constellation charts can help students locate patterns in the sky and find the planets moving among these star patterns.\r\nActivity: simulating the sun's path through the zodiac constellations\r\nMaterials: zodiac constellations (pages 61 and 62), overhead projector, 12 sheets of large black construction paper, chalk or white marker, clamp-on light with 150-watt bulb\nLesson Preparation\n\nMake transparencies of the zodiac constellations. Project them onto the large black paper individually; use the white marker to trace the stars (dots) and lines. The sizes of the dots denote brightness, not size. The larger dots are brighter stars.\nInclude the constellation name, when the sun is there, and when it is seen.\nUse a large room for this lesson. Using a string four feet (122 cm) long with a loop at one end and a piece of chalk tied to the other, make a circle in the center of the floor. Have someone hold the loop of the string in the center of the floor, stretch out the string, and use the chalk to draw the circle. Shorten the string to 2.5 feet (76 cm) and draw another circle within the first, using the same center point. Place the lamp in the center of these circles at the students' eye level.\n\n\nProcedure\n\nShare the background information about the zodiac constellations, using the transparencies to enable students to see what they look like.\nTake the students to a large room. Have 12 students hold the zodiac pictures. Have them spread out equally around the large circle. The constellations should be in order of the numbers, moving in a clockwise direction around the circle.\nHave the remaining students stand around the inner circle, facing the constellations. Turn on the bright light and turn off the room lights. Tell students that the bright light is the sun and they are the Earth. Have them spin slowly in their positions in a counterclockwise direction (west to east) to simulate day and night. Day is when they face the sun (light), night when they face away from the light and see the stars.\nExplain that if they could go north out beyond the solar system, they would see the Earth move around the sun in a counterclockwise direction. Let them begin to walk slowly in a counterclockwise direction around the circle, looking at the constellations as they do so. Point out that these change as they move. Explain that from Earth we see new constellations gradually appearing in the eastern sky, as those in the west gradually disappear below the western horizon. It takes 12 months to get back to the original set of constellations. Have them walk all the way around the circle, mentally marking the constellation they see at the beginning, and stopping there after walking around the circle. Explain that they have just gone through one year.\nHave students collect on one side of the light, face towards it, and try to see the constellations opposite it. Explain that the sun is so bright we can't see the stars beyond it. Tell the students that the 12 zodiac constellations correspond to the location of the sun during each of the 12 months. When the sun is \"in\" one of them (e.g., Leo), we can't see the constellation. Only when we go into space, where sunlight is not scattered by Earth's atmosphere, can we see the stars and sun together. Even then, some of the stars near the sun are hard to see due to its bright light. We can catch glimpses of bright stars and planets during a total solar eclipse, when we can see beyond our atmosphere.\nExplain that planets and our moon move around the sun on a plane, like a huge dinner plate with the sun in the center. The zodiac constellations lie beyond this plane, appearing roughly east to west across Earth's sky. The planets, moon, and sun never appear in the sky north or south of this band of stars.\nReview the zodiac constellations and look closely at the figures these star patterns are supposed to represent. Ask students which ones most resemble the pictures. These are Leo, (lion), Scorpio (scorpion), and Taurus (bull--face and horns only).\nMake enlarged copies of some of these constellations without the lines for the students to make their own constellations. Have them use the patterns of the stars (dots) to turn them into pictures of things familiar to them.\nHave students research the legends connected with constellations. These may be found at the Web site below. Click on Star Myths to reach links to a wide variety of legends about various constellations and planets.\n",

        "Directions": "Introduction\r\nA clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate.  The subject of a clause may be expressed or understood. \r\nThere are two types of clauses.\r\n(a)\r\nA main clause (independent clause) contains the main thought of the sentence and makes sense standing alone.\r\nExamples:  I spoke to the teacher who is our football coach.\r\nThe dog that was barking chased me across the lawn.\r\n(b)\r\nA subordinate clause (dependent clause) cannot make sense standing on its own.  To make a sentence, a subordinate clause must be added to a main clause.\r\nExamples:  I saw the dog when I came home.\r\nThey went to the store so they could buy ice cream.\r\nSubordinate clauses add information to a sentence and function in the same way as adjectives, adverbs, or nouns.\r\nExamples:\r\nThe woman who received the prize is my mother.  (adjective)\r\nOur class stops working when the bell rings.  (adverb)\r\nI think that we should always do the right thing.  (noun)\r\nSentences are analyzed by finding and naming the clauses.\r\n(a)\r\nSimple sentences consist of one clause.\r\nExample: \r\nHorses run.\r\n(b) Complex sentences have more than one subject-verb combination and thus have more than one clause.  A complex sentence has at least one main clause and one or more subordinate clauses.  A subordinate clause is introduced by a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun.\r\nExample:  I was resting while he was swimming laps.\r\n(c)\r\nCompound sentences consist of two or more main clauses (independent clauses) joined by a conjunction.\r\nExample:  I washed the dishes, and Billy dried them.\r\nTeaching Strategies\nThe main thing \r\nProvide students with practice in finding the main clause in a sentence by having them search through a photocopy of a familiar story, circling the main clauses. Remind them that a main clause can stand alone and contains the main thought of the sentence.  Point out that a simple sentence is, in fact, one main clause.\r\nMain clause beep\r\nHave children sit in a circle.  Choose a child to say a word to start a clause.  Each child in turn then adds a word to build a main clause.  When the clause is complete, the next child says \"Beep.\"  The game can be extended to add a subordinate clause to the main clause.\r\nAct the clause \r\nOrganize children in groups of four.  Tell groups that the first child is to provide a verb, the second child is to provide a subject, the third child is to arrange the verb and subject to make a clause, and the fourth child is to act out the clause.  Ensure that all children get a turn in each role.\r\nClause match-up \r\nHave children match main clauses to subordinate clauses.  This is also an excellent reading activity.\n\n\n\n These are the brave boys   \n because he was feeling ill.   \n\n\n Bill did not come   \n where the bus stop was.   \n\n\n The bus driver didn't know   \n who rescued the drowning child.   \n\n\n\n\r\nClause call-out \r\nWrite a main clause on the chalkboard and challenge children to call out appropriate subordinate clauses.\n\n\n\n We went to the park   \n when we had eaten lunch.   \n\n\n \n where the banana tree grows.   \n\n\n \n because we wanted to play.   \n\n\n\n\r\nVerb search \r\nWrite some clauses on the chalkboard.  Have children search for and identify the verb in each clause.\r\nI saw the boy who broke the glass.\r\nAdd the verb\r\nHave children orally add missing verbs to clauses.\r\nI saw the boy who ten goals.\r\nI saw the boy who kicked ten goals.\r\nThe police arrested the thief who the jewels.\r\nThe police arrested the thief who stole the jewels.",

        "Directions": "Before the project begins, have students bring in comic books, daily comics, and Sunday comics.  Read them aloud.  Ask the students why comic books have never lost popularity.  Discuss the different kinds of comics written, subject matter, and the purpose of comics.  Ask the students if some comic strips or comic books continue with a daily sequence of events with problems and solutions.  Cite examples of comics that fill those requirements.  Discuss how comic strips can turn into comic books.  Explain to the students their assignment will be to create a comic book using imaginary characters that find a solution to a problem.  Use this project to encourage the theme of the enjoyment of recreational reading.\n\nStudents choose the dimensions of the size of their pictures.  Each page must have at least four to six panels with related captions.\nExplain that each panel size for the comic book picture must be the same for each page.  \nRequire that onomatopoetic words such as bang, boom, crash, clang, buzz, whoosh, swish, creak, eek, etc., be used occasionally.\nRead the student check-off list aloud to clarify all requirements.  Writing the comic strips for each page must precede the artwork and graphics.  Excessive violence, weapons, and blood are unacceptable.  This project is rated for a general audience.\nBrief student conferences on each student's rough draft should be held to facilitate complete sentence structure, descriptive adjectives, and action verb usage.  Peer editing during this project combines reading enjoyment and student affirmation with skill development.\nThe final due date provides the students with a day to read each other's creations.  This day fills the classroom with recreational reading and a positive climate for further emphasis on writing for entertainment.\n",

        "Objective": "Students learn about complex sentences.",
        "Directions": "A complex sentence is a sentence in which at least two ideas are combined into a single sentence.  What's so \"complex\" about that?  For example, look at the following sentence:\nBecause he forgot his wedding anniversary for the tenth straight year, Roger spent a week sleeping on the porch.\r\nThe two ideas expressed in the sentence are:\n\nRoger forgot his wedding anniversary for the tenth straight year, and\nRoger spent a week sleeping on the porch.\n\r\nThe two ideas could be expressed as two separate sentences, but they are more effectively expressed in a complex sentence.  In a complex sentence the two ideas can be combined in a way that shows their cause-and-effect relationship.  Notice how the word because explains to the reader the cause of Roger's problems.  What follows the cause is the effect:  Roger spent a week sleeping on the porch.\r\nIn the sentence about Roger, the word because is called a subordinating conjunction.  That might sound like a puzzling term, but it is simply a type of word that will help you show the relationships between your ideas.  Adverb clauses always begin with subordinating conjunctions.\n\n\n\nSubordinating Conjunctions\n\n\nTime\nCause and Effect\nContrast\n\n\nafter\nbecause\nalthough\n\n\nbefore\nsince\nwhile\n\n\nas soon as\nif\nthough\n\n\nas\neven though\nwhereas\n\n\nwhen\n \nunless\n\n\nuntil\n \n \n\n\nwhile\n \n \n\n\n\n\r\nHere is another example of two simple sentences that might be combined into a single complex sentence with an adverb clause:\r\nSimple Sentence\r\nThe jury didn't believe the woman.\r\nThe woman said that she killed her husband to prevent aliens from \r\ntorturing him.\r\nCombined Sentence\r\nThe jury didn't believe the woman when she said that she killed her husband to prevent aliens from torturing him.\r\nAs a writer, you have a choice to open a sentence with an adverb clause or end your sentence with an adverb clause.  Notice that when the adverb clause comes at the beginning, you use a comma to separate it from the rest of the sentence; but when the adverb clause comes at the end of the sentence, no comma is necessary.",

        "Description": "Language Arts, Reading, Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension",
        "Objective": "Students learn about using context clues to help them",
        "Directions": "Synonyms (sin-o-nims) are different words that have nearly the same meaning, as in this sentence: \"It was a hot, sultry day.\"\r\nThe way they are used here, \"hot\" and \"sultry\" mean much the same thing. And you can guess from the first what the second word means. As a rule of thumb, when two adjectives are used to describe the same thing, they often have similar or related meanings.\r\nAnother kind of context clue consists of explanations provided by the author. Authors want readers to understand what they write. When they use a word that readers may not be familiar with, they often explain it. This is especially true for words that belong to a special vocabulary. A special vocabulary means any group of words that is used mainly by one group of people. Doctors, for instance, have a special vocabulary. It includes words like arteriosclerosis, hypertension, thrombosis, and so on. The average person may not know these words. They don't have to, because they're not doctors. So when authors use one of these words, they often explain it for readers in context.\r\nWatch how the term \"cardiopulmonary resuscitation\" is explained in the context of this next article:\r\nTeen Saves Life at Reunion\r\nORANGE--Chris Walker knew just what to do when his aunt, Wilma Walker, collapsed of a heart attack at the Walker family reunion Sunday. The 16-year-old immediately began cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to circulate blood and provide oxygen until heart and lung function could be restored.\r\nNotice how the term cardiopulmonary resuscitation is explained for readers. It's something you do \"to circulate blood and provide oxygen until heart and lung function can be restored.\"\r\nNew words are often explained this way in textbooks too. The authors of textbooks don't expect you to know all the words they use. Nor do they expect you to stop and look them up. So they explain many of them as they go along.\r\nTake the following passage from a biology book, for example. It introduces the word metabolism. This is a new word for most students. So the author defines it for readers in context. Watch for its meaning as you read the passage:\r\nMalaria is a dramatic disease. In a typical attack, the victim first feels a severe chill. Gooseflesh forms, and his teeth chatter violently. Several hours later the sufferer feels very hot. He probably has a terrible headache and a feeling of nausea. Still later he begins to sweat. Clearly, the person's metabolism-that is, the way the parts of his body are working together-has been greatly upset by the disease.\r\nNotice how the author defines the word metabolism for the reader. Metabolism means \"the way the parts of the body are working together.\" As an example, the author describes how the disease upsets the normal process.\r\nDistribute the activity sheets to students and have them use what they have learned about context clues to complete the activity.",

        "Objective": "Students practice writing historical reports such as are done by emergency medical technicians and police officers.",
        "Directions": "Preparation\n\nIf possible, arrange for a visit by a police officer and/or emergency medical technician to speak to students about writing reports in their jobs.  An alternative is to arrange a field trip to a police station, fire station, (most now have paramedics on staff), or ambulance company.  Students think of these jobs as having glamour and do not realize that one of their most important responsibilities is writing reports.\n\nProcedure \n\nInform students they are going to learn a new kind of writing called historical writing--not because it's about an event like the Civil War or the Industrial Revolution, but because it is written to record what is happening right now but will be history once it is over.  Tell them historical writing seems easy.  They don't have to develop characters or write proper paragraphs with topic sentences as they do in writing fiction or essays.  They do have to write in detail and with accuracy, recording exactly what is happening, or has happened, in a situation.  It is the kind of writing done by doctors, nurses, firefighters, paramedics, and police officers.\nArrange for a visit from police officers or emergency medical technicians (optional but desirable), or a field trip to the paramedics of a fire station or a police station to visit with professionals for whom writing reports is a daily necessity.\nTo practice writing a chronological summary such as one a police officer must write, dictate the following fictional account of an incident which students are to record in a one-paragraph summary.\n\r\n    Jennifer Cortez was waiting in line in a convenience store when an armed gunman ran into the store and pushed a gun in the face of the clerk.  \"Give me all the money in your cash register right now!\" he shouted.  Still watching the clerk, he turned to the four people standing in line and shouted, \"Turn your faces around to the back of the store and put your hands up!\"  Jennifer was standing in line to pay for a soda and was startled.  The gunman wore a ski mask, a black sweatshirt, jeans, and dark glasses.  Jennifer began to cry because she was so scared.  \"Count to 10 before you turn around!\"  the gunman said, collecting the money; then he backed out the door and ran around the side of the building.  The clerk called the police.\n\r\n    Have students fill out the Crime Report (page 81) and write a one-paragraph summary of the incident with the information given.  In the paragraph, write only the necessary facts and write them in the exact order in which they happened.  Will you need to write that Jennifer cried?  No. Will you need to write that the gunman wore a mask? Yes. Discuss any problems or questions the students have.\r\n    Display the Prehospital Care Report (page 82).  Explain that this is the kind of report a paramedic must fill out for every patient.  Note that information on this form consists of medical data with a detailed description of the patient's physical condition, including injuries and data regarding the patient's allergies and medical history.  \"Chief complaint\" would be the reason a paramedic was called.  Instead of a summary such as a police officer writes, a paramedic lists events and the times when they occur.  Time is given in military time--that is, in number of hours since 12:00 midnight.  In military time two P.M. would be 14:00 hours.  On this particular report we have the following:\n\n\n\n\n 23:20   \n Arrived on scene--assessed pt. (patient)   \n\n\n 23:25   \n Extricated from car with spine precautions   \n\n\n 23:26   \n Vital signs taken (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration)   \n\n\n\n\n\nRead the Emergency Incident (page 84) to students.  They are going to write crime reports and prehospital care reports for this incident.  Divide the class into cooperative learning groups.  Distribute to each group a blank crime report (page 81), a blank Prehospital Care Report (page 83), and a copy of the Emergency Incident (page 84).  Elicit from students that this incident is a crime because the driver of the car left the scene of the accident, which is hit and run--a crime.  Instruct each group to assign one person as recorder for the group, and to choose this person carefully because the report must be very neat.  When the activity is complete, discuss the student's results.  This activity may be repeated as often as needed until students are competent report writers.\n\r\nBackground/Follow-Up\r\nIt is said that over 90 percent of police recruits who do not make it onto the force fail because they are unable to write clear and accurate reports.  The same is true for paramedics, nurses, and doctors.  Clear, accurate reports are essential for success in any of these fields.",

        "Objective": "Students practice creating resumes.",
        "Directions": "Since many students do not yet work, one way to practice resume writing is to have students pick a career they might be interested in pursuing in the future.  With the help of the class, list several possible career choices on the board or overhead.  Next, pass out sections of the classifieds to the students.  Explain how the classifieds are organized.  Show students how to find jobs that have been listed on the board.  Next, look for jobs that no one has mentioned.\r\nAfter students have seen what types of jobs are available, you can assign careers in one of two ways:\n\nHave students look through the classifieds and decide on a job.\nHave students draw from a collection of classified advertisements that you have previously cut out and gathered.\n\r\nWhen students decide on jobs, help them determine what type of education, work experience, etc., they will need for the job.  Encourage students to be creative and make up whatever information they will need for their resume.\r\nHave students create their own resumes by studying the sample resume on page 51.  If students do not have access to a computer, you may want to allow the resumes to be handwritten.\r\nFor an optional activity, hand out only five or six different job descriptions to the entire class.  This way several students will apply for the same job.  Determine which students have the same jobs and set up a date for students to interview for the position.  The teacher can act as the employer, or another adult can be invited to the classroom to help with this activity.  Have the students interview for the jobs and compare their resumes to determine who gets \"hired\" for the position.\r\nUse the following information to instruct students about writing a resume:\r\nUnless you happen to know a friend or relative who is hiring, getting a job is not always easy.  It takes more to get a job than simply being a nice person.  Most companies will require you to show how qualified you are for the job you want.  Most will want to know your educational background and other job-related experiences that you've had.\r\nEmployers do not expect students to have extensive work experience, but they do want a resume that shows you have experience as a leader and that you would be a benefit to the company if they hired you.\r\nNot every job requires a resume.  Many jobs only require that you fill out an application.  However, it is a good idea to have an updated resume on file at all times so that when a job becomes available that does require a resume, you are ready to go.  Remember these helpful hints when writing your own resume:\n\nA resume lists a person's qualifications for a job.\nIt includes a person's name, address, and telephone number.\nIt includes a person's educational information and previous work experience.\nInformation on a resume should be listed in chronological order, listing the most recent experiences first.\n\n\r\nOn a resume, do not include your work experience if it is not relative to the job you are trying to get.  As a person gains more education, it is no longer necessary to include information such as middle school attended, etc.  However, if you are a student in high school and you are trying to get a job as a counselor at a summer camp, this type of information is relevant to your resume.\r\nA resume should always be typed, and it should be no longer than one page.  There is no one correct style for a resume, but information should be neatly arranged on the page.  Remember that you are trying to persuade someone to hire you, so be sure and emphasize any qualifications you might have that will help you get the job.  A student looking for a job may want to include on his or her resume  items such as community service or future goals.\r\nSome companies may ask for a written reference from your friends, family, or past employers.  A written reference is a letter from someone that recommends you as a good employee or worker.  Others may ask for a list of names and phone numbers of your references so that the employer can call and speak personally to the references you have given.",

        "Directions": "The impromptu speech is an unprepared speech that one gives with spontaneity.  It is often done when the speaker draws a topic--sometimes a silly one--and gives the speech off the top of his or her head.  Each member of the class can supply one topic to put into the drawing.  If preferred, the class may base their speeches on the topics suggested on page 15.  \r\nA speaker may prepare an impromptu speech by following the basic three-point speaker outline:  Introduction, Body, and Conclusion.\n\n Notes on the Introduction\r\nThe introduction may be an attention-getting statement, joke, or anecdote.  It is always a good idea for speakers to learn famous or well-known quotations, since these make great introductions.  It is also possible to present a simple incident in a dramatic or storytelling format.\r\nExample:  A young child rummages through the garbage behind a grocery store.  She pulls her thin jacket around her frail body and shivers against the cold.  For her, this subject--hunger in America--is a harsh reality.\r\nThis introduction has accomplished several goals:\n\ngotten the attention of the listener\npersonalized the subject\ncreated sympathy for a presented need\nprovided an organizational tool to restate the need and develop a conclusion.\n\nNotes on the Conclusion\r\nWhen presenting a conclusion, refer back to the introduction.  \r\nExample:  Feeding the hungry may hold little interest for the comfortable, but, to the child rummaging through garbage for provisions, it is of immediate interest today--and has an even graver impact on her tomorrows.",

        "Directions": "We all know the importance of teaching students to write clear, well-structured essays.  After all, the essay is the basic of most academic writing.  But we also know that teaching essay writing is not easy.  An introduction and conclusion are vital elements of a good essay.\r\nThe introduction of an essay serves two purposes: it clarifies what the essay is about, and it grabs the readers interest.  The first goal is straightforward.  The second is more challenging.\r\nAsk students to think about some of their favorite movies.  Ask them to think about how the movies begin.  They will probably discover that most movies begin with a dramatic or suspenseful opening.  This is called a hook.  Whether it is a bit of slapstick humor or a violent encounter, the hook is intended to get you involved with the story right away and keep you watching.  The same principle applies to essay writing.\r\nTell students that this does not mean that they must begin their essays with a sensational opening.  However, they should interest the reader by showing, not telling.  Read the following two sentences to them:\r\n\"Kids eat a lot of food that is really bad for them.\"\r\n\"The sugar-coated purple cereal is disappearing as you slurp it down with chocolate milk.\"\r\nThe first sentence does a good job of clarifying the topic.  But which did students prefer?  The second version is more lively, beginning with a story line and grabbing the interest of the reader.  The words are lively and we are shown someone eating instead of being told about it.\r\nThe first sentence does not have to be quite so dramatic to catch the interest of the reader.  A sentence that gets the reader involved can also work.  For example-\"What do you think of when you hear the words health food?\"\r\nThe primary purpose of the conclusion is to bring the paper to an end, to wrap it up.  Like introductions, good conclusions are interesting, leaving the reader with a strong sense of the paper.  You should mention the points that you just covered, but you don't need to spell them out.  This can be done in a number of ways.  Read the following two conclusion sentences to students:\r\n\"In conclusion, eating healthful foods makes a lot of sense.\"\r\n\"So, the next time you pop that jaw breaker into your mouth, the next time you eat oily potato chips for dinner, remember that there are tasty choices that won't hurt your body.\"\r\nThe first sentence is OK.  It uses the helpful phrase in conclusion and reminds the reader what he or she just read.  But ask students again which sentence they preferred.  The second example is livelier and brings the essay to a close while keeping the reader involved.  It also has the same kinds of story line as the second introduction.  This is called an envelope strategy, which is common in essay and story writing.  You open and close your essay in the same way.  This helps to give your essay a sense of order.\r\nDistribute copies of the Introductions and Conclusions activity sheet to students and have them try writing some interesting and lively introductions and conclusions.",

        "Directions": "This is an enjoyable activity that can be incorporated into the classroom curriculum or used as Friday afternoon lessons.  Before you begin, have students bring in newspapers from home.  If students are unable to bring in newspapers, you can contact your local newspaper.  Many publishers have specific programs for schools where copies of newspapers can be purchased at a reduced rate.  Find an empty counter space and stack them in specific sections.  For example, in one pile put sports, in another pile put want ads, etc.\r\nScavenger Hunts are random ten-item lists.  No two students will have the same answers on their sheets upon completion of this activity. \r\nYou might wish to divide the class into groups.  Have each group go to the newspaper counter and take a section from each pile.  Give the groups a copy of the Scavenger Hunt work sheet to put their answers on.  Each group will also need scissors and glue.  Students may use any section of the newspaper to find possible solutions.  Allow students to use maps or other reference materials as needed.\r\nYou will have to judge whether or not students find appropriate responses.  Have students justify their answers if there are doubts.  For example, if the list item says \"Something that you eat for lunch,\" and a group of students glues the word \"egg\" on their answer sheet, you might respond by telling them that an egg is a breakfast food.  If one student tells you that he or she had an egg salad for lunch, the group should be given credit for their response.  Interactions like these are not uncommon.  Allow students to use words or pictures from the newspaper, especially when the list item is followed by \"word\" or \"picture.\"",

A phrase is a group of words that doesn't make a whole sentence--a group of words that do a job together.  These are all prepositional phrases:\r\nunder the log, on the log, by the log, in the log \r\nPrepositional phrases always begin with a preposition and end with the object of the preposition.  The object of the preposition is a word that answers What? or Whom? about the preposition.  Under what? The log.  On what?  The log.  In all the above prepositional phrases, log is the object of the preposition.\r\nHere is a list of common prepositions:\n\n\n\n aboard\r\n            about\r\n            above\r\n            across\r\n            after\r\n            against\r\n            along\r\n            among\r\n            around\r\n            at   \n before\r\n            behind\r\n            below\r\n            beneath\r\n            beside\r\n            besides\r\n            between\r\n            beyond\r\n            but\r\n            by   \n down\r\n            during\r\n            except\r\n            for\r\n            from\r\n            in\r\n            inside\r\n            into\r\n            like\r\n            near   \n of\r\n            off\r\n            on\r\n            onto\r\n            out\r\n            outside\r\n            over\r\n            past\r\n            through\r\n            throughout   \n to\r\n            toward\r\n            under\r\n            underneath\r\n            until\r\n            up\r\n            upon\r\n            with\r\n            within\r\n            without   \n\n\n\n\r\nPrepositions can also be made up of more than one word.

        "Directions": "Introduction\r\nPrepositions are words we use to show the relationship of a noun or a pronoun to another word in the sentence.  They can be called place words because they often tell us the positions of things. \r\nExamples:  \r\nThe puppy is on the chair.\r\nThe girl is beside the chair.\r\nThe bone is under the chair.\r\nThe prepositions on, beside, and under all refer to the noun chair.  They tell us the relationship between it and the puppy, the girl, and the bone.\n\nProblem prepositions\namong/between-Something is shared among several people or things (three or more).  Something is shared between two people or things.\r\nExamples:  \r\nI divided the cake among the whole class.\r\nI divided the cake between Mary and me.\nin/into-In shows position in one place.  Into shows movement from one place to another.\r\nExamples:  \r\nThe teacher is in the room.\r\nThe boy dived into the river.\ndifferent from-One thing or person is different from another.  Never say different than.\nbeside/besides-Beside means at the side of.  Besides means in addition to.\r\nExamples:  \r\nThe teacher stood beside the table.\r\nSeveral girls were there besides Margaret.\n\nPreposition or adverb? \r\nSome prepositions may look like adverbs.  To tell whether the word is a preposition or an adverb, look at the way it is used.  Look at the following sentences.\r\nI fell down.  Down is an adverb of place.  It tells where I fell.\r\nI walked down the road.  Down is a preposition governing road.\r\nRemember also that a preposition has a noun or pronoun after it.\nTeaching Strategies \nQuestion time \r\nAsk children to describe the positions of some objects in the classroom.  Tell children they must reply using a preposition in a sentence.\r\nWhere is the clock?\r\nThe clock is under the picture.\r\nWhere is the television?\r\nThe television is beside the table.\nPreposition opposites \r\nHave children provide the opposites of given prepositions.\r\nThe snake crawled over the rock.\r\nThe snake crawled under the rock.\nJumbled prepositions\r\nGive children exercises in which the prepositions are jumbled.  Have children identify the preposition or write it correctly.\r\nThe bird flew (voer) the tree.\r\nThe bird flew over the tree.\nWord Bank Prepositions\n\n\n\n above   \n by   \n opposite   \n\n\n across   \n down   \n outside   \n\n\n after   \n during   \n over   \n\n\n against   \n except   \n past   \n\n\n among   \n for   \n since   \n\n\n around   \n from   \n through   \n\n\n at   \n in   \n to   \n\n\n before   \n inside   \n towards   \n\n\n behind   \n into   \n underneath   \n\n\n below   \n near   \n until   \n\n\n beside   \n of   \n upon   \n\n\n between   \n off   \n within   \n\n\n beyond   \n onto   \n without   \n\n\n",

Have the student use the gray guidelines to complete the chart for the way he or she spends the day.  The gray lines mark every hour.  The student should trace over the appropriate lines with a crayon.  The represented segment (label) can then be written darkly in the space with pencil or pen, and then the space filled in lightly with crayon so as not to cover the label.  Each segment should use a different color crayon so they are easily distinguishable from one another.\nLooking at the completed pie chart, each student should consider the use of time it reflects and find a problem area (e.g., too much television time or too little sleep).  Now, distribute a second copy of the Pie Chart Template.  Determining the problem, the student should complete a new pie chart that reflects a solution--a better use of time.\nWith pie charts in hand, the student will write a problem-and-solution essay:  the problem is the original use of time, and the solution is the new arrangement.

        "Directions": "Storytelling\n\nThe art of storytelling has been around almost as long as humans have.  Stories have been passed down as family treasures to be taken out, enjoyed, wrapped in memories, and carefully tucked away to be cherished by yet another generation.  The stories of how our families came to settle where they did; how they survived hard times; how our parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles met and married have become the keynote speeches of the family dinners.\r\nThe ability to relate a story well is a skill that will enrich everyone's lives and create emotional ties between new generations of our families and friends.  These are the stories most requested by separated or adopted children.  The stories provide us with a sense of belonging and a secure place in the world.\n\r\nStories are priceless gifts that should not be lost with the passing of our family members but should be filed away to be discovered and treasured by future generations.  The struggles our families faced to settle a new world and our victories over those struggles provide our strength to overcome future struggles that we--or our children--might face.\n\r\nWe are all survivors of the perils of the ages and have in our families stories of the Civil War, westward expansion, persecution, and the fabric that makes up the history of mankind.  Develop and preserve these stories and the ability to relate them.\n\r\nThe activity that follows provides the format and opportunity to develop these storytelling skills.  The stories may be organized by use of an organizer called the storyboard.  The stories need not be written out but rather organized in topical format, or outline, and related to the group.\n\nStorytelling:  Chill Out\n\nNo storytelling unit would be complete without the tale of terror.  The \"gotcha'\" stories are in this category also.  A gotcha' story is one that sounds frightening and is filled with suspense.  At the end the storyteller yells out and grabs someone close saying \"Gotcha'!\"  These stories are often related in the dark, at camp outs, and at slumber parties.  No doubt you have already heard many.\r\nThis is a story type that allows the storyteller to set the mood.  The speaker may build suspense by using facial expressions or vocal inflections.  A good storyteller can scare the daylights out of his or her listeners!  The success of recent horror movies shows us that many of us love to be scared.  Perhaps it is a way of confronting our fears and making us see how silly they really are.  There are classic tales of terror that have been told for generations.\n\nAssignment:  Prepare and tell a tale of terror you have heard, or create an original.  Use the storyboard organizer on page 100 to prepare your story and share it with the class.  The following is a list of classic tales of terror that circulate today.  These might help you select your own tale of terror.\n\nThe Man with the Hook Arm\nThe Hitchhiker\nA babysitter gets a call from a murderer who claims he is calling from inside the house.\nA girl is followed home by a man who keeps turning on his bright lights, only to discover he is trying to protect her from the person hiding in her back seat.\nThe girl at the slumber party  who goes to the grave to  plunge in a letter opener  to prove to others she is  not afraid.  She  unknowingly plunges it  into the hem of her  nightgown.  It pins her to  the grave; and thinking  she is being grabbed  by the living dead, she  dies of fright. \n\r\nThese are common stories, but you may have better tales of terror to tell!",

        "Directions": "Introduction \r\nGrammar is concerned with the way an overall text is structured to engage an audience and to deliver its message and with the way we choose particular words appropriate to that audience and message.  It is important to generate an interest in words and to encourage children to be thoughtful about the words they use.  If students develop an interest in language at an early age, they should continue to appreciate throughout their school life and into adulthood the richness and diversity of our ever-growing language.\r\nReview twin words with students.  These are words that are often paired together, especially in speech.  Example:  salt and pepper\r\nHave students complete the Twin Words activity sheet.\r\nTry some of these teaching strategies for additional grammar practice.\r\nHomophone hunt \r\nWrite a list of words on the chalkboard.  Challenge students to think of the corresponding homophones.  They can also create cartoons to illustrate the homophones.\n\n\n\nallowed/aloud\nate/eight\neye/I\nbare/bear\n\n\nbean/been\nblew/blue\nboard/bored\nbrake/break\n\n\nflea/flee\nhear/here\nknit/nit\none/won\n\n\npair/pear\nsun/son\n \n\n\n\n\r\nFish \r\nOn blank playing cards write pairs of synonyms, antonyms, or homophones. Encourage children to play \"Go Fish\" with them.\r\nScattered letters\r\nWrite a selection of letters scattered on the chalkboard.  Have children think of as many words as they can using the letters.  Make the game more challenging by introducing a timer.\r\nWord collection\r\nOrganize a word collection bulletin board in the classroom.  Encourage children to find, collect, and then display words on the board.  The board could have a number of different headings, such as Interesting Words,  Words That Sound Funny,  Words That Sound Like Noises,  Words That Sound Important.  Ask children to think of other headings they would like to use.\r\nTongue twisters \r\nChallenge children to say a tongue twister quickly.  Then have them make up their own tongue twisters for their friends to try.\r\nShe sells seashells by the seashore.\r\nOdd words \r\nHave children search for words with interesting or unusual features.  Here are some to start them off.\r\nhijinks: three dotted letters in a row\r\nstrength: eight letters but only one vowel\r\nsubbookkeeper: four sets of double letters\r\nfacetious: all the vowels in their correct order\r\ncauliflower: contains all the vowels\r\neducation: contains all the vowels\r\nDaily letter race \r\nChallenge children to write in two minutes all the words they can that begin with the first letter of that day of the week.\r\nWord link\r\nHave one child say a word.  The next child has to respond by saying a word that starts with the letter that the first word ended with.  Make the game more or less challenging by setting a rule determining the minimum number of letters or syllables that the words must have, or require a specific part of speech.\n\n\n\nRule:\ntwo or more syllables\n\n\nFirst child:\nhumor\n\n\nSecond child:\nrubble\n\n\nThird child:\nelephant\n\n\n\n\r\nContinuous story\r\nDivide the class into groups.  Have one child in each group start a story by saying one word.  The next child in the group then adds another word and so on until the group has, word by word, written a story that makes sense.  The group that can go on the longest is the winner.",

        "Directions": "Give students the following information about using transitions in writing.\r\nParagraphs are the building blocks of an essay.  This is particularly true in a format as straightforward as the five-paragraph essay.  Each paragraph counts as its own unit and serves a unique purpose. \r\nWhen writing paragraphs, it is important for the series of ideas flow together.  They do so with the help of transitions.  Without effective transitions, your paragraphs will come across as disconnected, as a series of facts without any relationship.  Transitions link ideas so that they relate to one another; they provide comparison and contrast, and they strengthen and weaken ideas.\r\nKeep in mind that you need transitions between paragraphs, too.  In some cases, transitions are single words.  Other times they consist of more than one word, in which case they are called transitional phrases.\r\nWrite on the board or give as a handout the list of transitions below.\r\nabove\r\naccording to\r\nafter\r\nalso\r\nalthough\r\nanother\r\nbecause\r\nbeside(s)\r\nclearly\r\nconsequently\r\nfinally\r\nfirst, second . . .\r\nfor example\r\nfor instance\r\nfurthermore\r\nhowever\r\nin addition to\r\nin fact\r\nlast\r\nmeanwhile\r\nmoreover\r\nnevertheless\r\nnext\r\nobviously\r\nof course\r\nsimilarly\r\nsince\r\ntherefore\r\nwhile\r\nyet\r\nTransitions serve all sorts of purposes.

For example, we have to clean the house.\"\r\nTransitions and transitional phrases don't always have to appear at the beginning of a sentence.  \r\n\"It is, however, important to vote when you turn eighteen.\"\r\nDistribute copies of the Using Transitions activity sheet to students.

        "Directions": "Present the following to students:\r\nAgreement of Pronoun and Antecedent\r\nWhat is an antecedent?  An antecedent is the word to which a pronoun refers.\r\nBetty brought her book to class.\r\nIn this sentence, her is the only pronoun.  Its antecedent is Betty because Betty is the word to which the pronoun refers.  When we talk about pronoun-antecedent agreement, we mean that pronouns must agree in number and gender with their antecedents.  If Betty is the antecedent, we couldn't say, \"Betty brought his book,\" or \"Betty brought their book.\"  In those sentences, the pronouns don't agree with their antecedents.\r\nThe only time this gets tricky is when we use the indefinite pronouns.  These are indefinite pronouns:\r\none, everyone, someone, no one, anyone, everybody, nobody, anybody, somebody, each, either, neither, several, few, both, many, all, most, any, none.\r\nHere are the rules about using indefinite pronouns properly so that the pronoun and antecedent agree:\n\nThese indefinite pronouns are singular and therefore take a singular antecedent: one, everyone, someone, no one, anyone, everybody, nobody, anybody, somebody, each, either, neither.\n\r\nIt's easy to remember most of these because most of them end in either one or body, and we know that one and body are singular.\r\nEverybody has his or her book.\r\nNote: In the above sentence, many people would use the word their in place of his or her.  This is incorrect because everybody is a singular pronoun which is not gender specific.  Many people prefer to use the male pronoun his when referring to all of us.  This is still considered acceptable grammar.  Nowadays, however, we generally say his or her so that we have a singular pronoun and are not being gender-biased.\n\nThese indefinite pronouns are plural and therefore take plural antecedents: several, few, both, many.\n\r\n(Write the following sentences on the board and have students identify the antecedents)\r\nSeveral students lost their books.\r\nMany of us have taken our tests.\n\nThese indefinite pronouns may be either singular or plural, depending on how they are used in a sentence: all, most, any, none.\n\r\n(Write the following on the board and have students identify whether the pronouns should be singular or plural.)\r\nMost of the apples are rotten. (plural)\r\nMost of the milk is gone. (singular)\r\nNote: If a sentence has a compound antecedent (more than one) joined by or or nor, the pronoun agrees with the antecedent closer to it.\r\nEither the girls or Jose brought his car.\r\nEither Jose or the girls brought their car.\r\nDistribute the activity sheets and have students practice the rules that they have learned.",

        "Directions": "This activity can be completed as part of a Women's History Month unit, or as a standalone activity.\r\nBegin the activity by introducing students to Nelly Bly, who was a woman reporter long before it was common to find women in the field.\r\nWhat twenty-year-old woman in 1887 would dare have herself committed to a mental institution in order to write an article about the treatment of the mentally ill?  Having achieved success with this technique once, what woman would dare to try it again to find out about prison life, sweat shops, and slums?  The only correct answer to both questions is Elizabeth Cochran Seaman, better known as Nelly Bly!\r\nElizabeth received her first job when she wrote a response to an article that appeared in the Pittsburgh Dispatch.  The article had been titled \"What Girls Are Good For.\"  Elizabeth's letter convinced many people, including the editor of the Dispatch, that women were good for writing.\r\nAmerica became aware of the woman reporter through the work of \"Nelly Bly,\" Elizabeth's pen name taken from a song by Stephen Foster.  For her stories, she went down in a diving bell and up in a balloon; she posed as a Salvation Army worker, a ballet dancer, and a criminal; she even spent the night in a house that was supposed to be haunted.\r\nBut her greatest feat was a trip around the world in only 72 days, 6 hours, and 11 minutes; she had broken the record of a character in Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days.  By using trains, boats, and horses, she had made the trip of a lifetime and had even found time to stop in France and interview Verne himself.  The headline on the day of the twenty-three-old woman's return to New York was \"Father Time Outdone.\"  Elizabeth often laughed and told about her uncle who had also traveled around the world--in a period of three years.\r\nWhen Elizabeth was thirty, she married millionaire Robert Seaman who was eighty years old.  Elizabeth retired from her work as a reporter.  When Seaman died in 1904, she attempted to run his business, but lawsuits with employees cost her the fortune.  Elizabeth returned to newspaper writing.\r\nAt a time in history when many women were restricted to housework and family, Elizabeth was a pace-setter with her travels, her adventures, and her writing.  Until her death by pneumonia in 1922 at age 55, she was employed at the New York Journal and doing what she liked best--writing!\r\nSuggested Activities\n\nDiscussion Questions\r\n    \nKnowledge: What was Nelly Bly's married name?\nComprehension: Why was a trip around the world so unusual in Nelly's time?\nCreative Thinking: Plan a news story that Nelly might wish to cover in your community.  Remember that she covered haunted houses, hospital visits, and tried various occupations.\nApplication: Write a news story about something that is going on in your school.  Be sure to give it a \"catchy\" title.\nAnalysis: List some of the news stories that Nelly Bly wrote.\nSynthesis: Plan a trip around the world for Nelly today.  Try to use as many means of transportation as possible.  Do not forget you can include camels and donkeys as well as rockets and planes.  (Be sure to use the animals in their appropriate settings.)  To help you, use a chart with these headings: From (Place), To (Place), Method of Transportation.\nEvaluation: Which of the modes of transportation you listed above is the most unusual?  Which do you think Nelly would enjoy most?  Why?\nAffective: Nelly made a difference by writing about the treatment of the mentally ill people.  Is there a group of people in society today that is not getting a \"fair shake\" in your opinion?  Is there anything you can do to make a difference in their lives?\n\n\nSkills Focus\r\n    \nLanguage and Communication Skills: Pretend you are Nelly Bly and that you have just completed the trip around the world as planned in the activity above.  Have a friend interview you and ask you questions about that trip.\nIndependent Study Skills: Is there an award given to good news stories?  Use your library to find out about this award(s).\nManipulative Skills: Using a large sheet of construction paper, display the news stories each class member has written.  Post the \"newspaper\" somewhere in your school for others to see.\n\n\nSocial Science\r\n    \nJob Description:  When you accompany your parents to the grocery store or when you visit the school cafeteria, observe the workers.  Watch what they do.  Watch what others say to them.  When you get a chance, write a description of one of the jobs.  What are the good points of that job?  Are there bad points?  Describe this occupation as Nelly Bly might have written about it.\n\n\n\n\r\nDistribute the Newspaper Article activity sheet to students.  Have them use what they have learned about Nelly Bly to complete the activity.",
