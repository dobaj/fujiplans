"Title: Three Little Kittens: Addition Booklet
Grade Level: Preschool - 1st Grades
Description: Language Arts, Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.)
Objective: Students will copy and extend patterns; use symbols in equations; solve simple equations; recognize and collects data; understand the problem; choose a problem-solving strategy; and implement a problem-solving strategy.
Directions: Before the Lesson

Prepare the addition books for each student.  Reproduce pages 54-55.  Cut the pages so that there is one addition problem per page.  The cover sheet should be on top.  Staple them along the left side with two staples in book form.  Each book should contain four pages.
Make a pair of mittens for each student or request a pair of mittens or gloves from home labeled with the student's name.  If you are making the mittens with paper, make each pair different.  Vary the colors or designs.  Try using wallpaper samples instead of construction paper for variety.  They are sturdy and can be quite colorful.  
Make a floor chart, using butcher paper or masking tape.

Procedure

Reread the nursery rhyme Three Little Kittens.
Ask the students if they have ever lost anything.  Ask them to share with the class problem-solving strategies that they used to find the items.
Have one-half of the class get out their mittens and put them into a pile.  Mix the pile and randomly hand each student from the other half of the class one mitten.  Ask the students to find the persons who have the matching mittens.
When the students have found the mates to their mittens, have them describe to their partners the properties they looked for while trying to find the mates.
Gather the mittens and put them aside.
Repeat the activity with the other half of the class' mittens.
Return the mittens to the original owners when the activity is complete.
Graph the number of mittens on the floor graph.  Discuss the results (of which are there more, of which are there fewer).
Have the students sort and pattern the mittens in cooperative groups.

Center Idea
As a follow-up activity in a math center, have the students play mitten/kitten addition.  Each student receives two dice, tiny chart stickers, and a copy of My Addition Booklet.  Students will roll the dice and add them together to explore fact strategies.  Students will then record their answers in their activity books.  Each student will have room to record three math problems.

"Title: Narrative Writing
Grade Level: 1st - 2nd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Journaling
Objective: Students will learn about writing narrative nonfiction pieces.
Directions: Nonfiction narrative writing tells a story or an event that is true.  There are two primary categories of narrative writing--personal and biographical.  A personal narrative tells about the experiences of the author.  A biographical narrative tells the story of another person by the author, whether from personal observation or from history.  The structure must be organized to tell a story either in the order it happened or in some other logical sequence.  Many narratives also include messages, morals, or lessons as part of their purpose.

On pages 161 and 162 there are two examples of narrative autobiographical writing.  The first one is called This is Your Lifeline! and the second one is called Star of the Week.  Below are directions for both.

To help you get to know the children better and to help the children get to know one another better, a perfect writing activity for the beginning of the year is the lifeline.  Give each child six index cards along with a copy of page 161.  After completing page 161, the sentences are cut apart and glued to the back of each card.  Each child brings in a photograph for every year of his or her life and glues each to the front of each corresponding card.  (You may have the child draw pictures instead of bringing in photos.)  The cards are attached together with yarn in chronological order (as shown on page 161) and displayed around the room for all to enjoy.  An optional card could be added that includes something the child may want to accomplish during the school year.

Each week in many classrooms a child is selected to be Star of the Week.  The child can be chosen by alphabetical order or in a random drawing until everyone has a turn.  To make the paper doll of the star of the week, trace an outline of the child on bulletin-board paper.  Have the child color the outline and display the cutout on the wall along with interview finish-me sentences (see page 162) about different parts of his or her body.  These sentences are completed, put on index cards, and glued or stapled to the doll.  At the end of the week, the star child takes the paper doll home to keep.

"Title: Math Detectives Activity: Alien Invaders!
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.), Problem Solving
Objective: Students become ""math detectives"" and solve a series of story problems or word problems in order to finish an adventure.  The activity connects math and reading while reinforcing critical thinking and problem-solving skills
Directions: Introduction
What is a Problem-Solving Math Mystery?
Children love a good adventure story.  It is even more exciting if they are ""living"" and experiencing the story!The adventure is divided into several parts.  Every part has an accompanying math problem that must be solved before the student can move on to the next part of the adventure.  Five answers with five page numbers are given with every problem.  If the student chooses the correct answer, a page number is given that continues the adventure.  If the incorrect answer is chosen, a page number is given that describes a less desirable turn of events, such as being made to do a thousand pushups by an alien fitness instructor.  Then the student must return to the last problem and try again.

Work must always be shown to ensure that the child can work and understand the math problem.  (Note:  If students need more work space they can use the blank page that precedes the page to which they must return.)  When the adventure is successfully completed, the student is given an Official Expert Math Detective Badge and promoted to the next detective level. 
It is recommended that the teacher have the students work in teacher-selected groups of four that each contain a strong reader and a strong math student (or a child with good problem-solving skills) for optimum success.  The students should each have their own story book (detective's notebook) and should each be responsible for showing their work.  Remind them that they will have the assistance of other group members to figure out what is being asked and how to solve the problems.  It is also beneficial to assign jobs to each group member such as the following:

Reader (This student reads the story parts to the group.)
Recorder (This student can record notes/ideas for group on scratch paper until the final answer is found.  Then all members record the work in their individual books.)
Task Master (This student makes sure that everyone is participating and on task.)
Questioner (This student is the only one allowed to raise his or her hand for adult help and then only if no one in the group can answer the question.)

 How to Use the Book

 Assembling the Story
The book is 24 half-pages long (12 full pages).  Once a book is photocopied, it can easily be cut along the dashed lines, collated, and stapled.  Each book has illustrated pages, and each of the pages is numbered. It is recommended that three staples be used on the left-hand margin because the pages will be turned often since the problems are scattered throughout the book, not in chronological order.  (That would be too easy!)

Reading the Stories and Solving the Math Mysteries
Before students begin, model how to use the book by following these steps:

Set the scene for the stories.

    Explain that the student is a junior math detective on his or her first case.  The student detective will be embarking on a special adventure.  They will have a detective's notebook (the assembled story book) that tells their story and must be used to show all of their detective's work.  (This is best done on the blank back of the page opposite the problem.)  If they can solve each problem in the story successfully, they move on to the next part of the adventure and ultimately solve the case, get promoted, and get assigned a new mission.  If they cannot solve a problem, something unfortunate will happen to them and they will have to try the problem again!
Model how to show the work in the detective's notebook (the storybook).

    An answer alone is not sufficient.  To demonstrate understanding of the problem and its solution, the student must draw a picture, write an equation, or write a simple sentence such as ""I got the answer by using the clock model in my detectives kit.""  Remind students that they must show proof that they know how to solve the problem just like real detectives do when they file a report.
Work the first two or three problems with the students.

    If students have not been exposed to many story or word problems before, this becomes a teachable moment.  For a whole class lesson, make an overhead transparency of the problems. 

    Here are several clues to share with the class.  You may wish to post them in the classroom as reminders for students.

    Detective Clues for Solving Math Story Problems

Every problem should be carefully read two times before trying to solve it.
Look for words that give you hints on what is to be done such as ""all together"" or ""in all"" which tends to mean you add, and ""got away"" or ""loses"" which tends to imply subtraction, etc.
Use the detective's kit whenever possible.
Read all of the answers before choosing one.  At least one or two should obviously be wrong.  There are also a few problems with more than one correct answer or an ""all of the above"" option.
If you are really stuck, try working backwards.  Choose an answer that looks reasonable and try to prove it correct.  (Remind the student, however, that a picture, an equation, or a sentence showing how the correct answer was arrived at must accompany all answers.) 
Use a bookmark or self-sticking note to mark the page you are on so that you do not lose your place if you turn to a page that is not the correct answer and you have to go back and work the problem again.  Remove the bookmark only when your work is shown and you have definitely found the correct answer and the next part of the adventure.  Then place the bookmark on this new page and continue as above.
When you have found all the correct answers, highlight them on each correct page.  Then, read the story from beginning to end using only the correct pages.


    Good luck on your adventure!

"Title: Drawing Word Problems
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Mathematics, Problem Solving
Objective: Students learn a three-step process to solve word problems.
Directions: Introduce the following information and examples to students.
A word problem tells about related facts and then asks a question.  A fact is information that is true.  A question is something that is asked and needs an answer.
The first step to solving a word problem is to read the problem a few times to find out the facts and the question.  Look for words in the problem that may give clues about whether to add, subtract, multiply, or divide.  This will help to find the answer.  Some of the words follow.
Addition: addends, all together, in all, many, more, sum, total
Subtraction: difference, fewer, left, many, more
Multiplication: factor, groups, how many, in all, multiple, product
Division: group, how many, in all, quotient, remainder, separate
The second step to solving a word problem is to name the words that give you clues about whether to add, subtract, multiply, or divide to solve the word problem.
Give students the following examples and ask if they know what they would need to do to solve the problem.
David has 15 baseball cards.  His brother gave him 15 more baseball cards.  How many in all? 
In the football game, Anthony scored 12 points.  Then he scored 18 more points.  What was the total number of points he scored? 
The third step to solving a word problem is to draw a picture to show the solution, or use real items to solve the problem.  In the following example, you could draw apples or use real ones.
Alyssa picked three baskets of apples.  Each basket had 14 apples.  How many apples were there in all?
The final step to solving a word problem is to look at the drawing or real-life example, write out the math sentence that it represents, and solve the problem.  For the apple problem, this step would be
14 + 14 + 14 = 42 apples

"Title: Easy Estimation
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Mathematics, Algebra and Function, Problem Solving
Objective: Students learn about using estimation to solve problems.
Directions: Using Estimation for Math Snacks
Estimation is an important math strategy.  Working with estimation can be an enjoyable addition to the daily math snacks activities.  Children love to guess how many there are of something and then count to see how close they came to the actual number answer.  One way to provide students with practice in estimating is to present them with a small sampling of a snack and have them estimate and count the items they have in front of them.  Another method is to provide one large class snack and take several guesses as to how many there are of the item before counting the entire snack in front of the class.  As you do this you are providing students with models of how to group and of the various strategies used for counting.
You can also take guesses on a large class snack and divide the counting responsibility among small groups of students.  When each group has finished counting its sample, you can model for the class, showing how you add two-digit and three-digit numbers to find a total.
Another estimation strategy is to use the serving information on snack packages to model how you, as the teacher, often decide whether a snack will be enough for the class.  It is also a way to show the multiplication of larger numbers in a real-life setting.
Yet another estimation strategy requires that you reveal more and more information until the students can accurately determine the total number of items in the container.  This method takes a little more preparation on the teacher's part.  Have students guess a total number based only on the external size of the container.  After the students have recorded their initial guesses, remind them that they cannot change the initial answer, but they can alter the following answers once you tell them more information.  Next, tell the students how many of the item fit inside one cup.  At this point, they can write a new answer down, or they can record the old answer if they feel it is still a reasonable answer.  Finally, tell the students how many cups fill the container.  Now, the students do the majority of their thinking as they know how many cups of items are in the container and how many items are in each cup.  Require that they show their thinking processes on paper and come up with final estimations as to how many items are in the container.  As with all math snacks activities, students should communicate their answers and their thinking.  When all estimation attempts have been made, count the items to find the actual total.

"Title: Eye Color
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Mathematics, Measurement (includes Time), Data Analysis and Probability
Objective: Students will complete a survey and compile the information in a graph.
Directions: Preparation

Reproduce the large eye patterns (page 52) and the bar graph (page 53) for students. Cut apart the eye patterns but do not color them. 
Obtain small hand-held mirrors for students to use. You may wish to have small groups of students share the mirrors to reduce the number needed. 

Directions

Begin this activity by discussing the similarities and differences among people's appearances. Point out what color your eyes are and explain that your eye color might be similar to some students but different from others. 
Provide mirrors for students to determine their eye colors. Have them tell you what color their eyes are. If necessary, help them identify their eye colors. Distribute the eye patterns according to students' eye colors. Ask students to color the patterns the same colors as their eyes. If a student has blue-green or hazel eyes, he or she can choose either blue or green, or you can substitute blue-green or hazel for gray on the eye pattern and graph. 
As you call each color (brown, blue, green, gray) listed on the table, have students raise their eye patterns if their eyes are that color. Invite the class to help you count the eye patterns to determine how many students have each eye color. Record the data on the overhead or the board. 
Use the floor or wall graph to model the activity. Show students how to mark the scale along the bottom, counting by ones, twos, or threes. Help students place the bars on the graph. 
Have students record the results on their bar graphs. 
Discuss the questions (page 53) and ask additional ones to check students' understanding. 

Extension Activities

Explain that the pupil is the black circle that is in the center of each eye. Point out that the pupil changes size to allow more or less light into the eye. The more light there is, the smaller the pupil gets. The less light there is, the larger the pupil gets. Assign partners or provide a mirror for each student. Turn off the lights for a couple of minutes. Ask students to observe the changes in the pupils. 
Create pictographs, using the small eye patterns (page 52). 
Invite students to name objects in the classroom that are the same colors as their eyes.

"Title: Accordion-Book Summary
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Art, Techniques
Objective: Students learn the basic steps of writing a book report and create an  eye-catching book summary.
Directions: Introduce to students the idea of writing reports on the books that they  read. The Book Report Basics will help them get started. These basics introduce  the necessary skills and knowledge that students will need to create effective  book reports. Students can use this knowledge to complete the Accordion-Book  Summary activity.
Book Report Basics
Writing Skills
The basic steps in the writing process include the following: 
Prewriting
In this step you brainstorm, think about your topic, create webs and  clusters, outline, research, and play around with ideas and words.
First Draft Writing
This is when you simply write all your ideas. Don't worry about anything  except saying what you want to say.
Revision
After you write your rough draft, go back over what you wrote. Correct  spelling and grammar, look up any words you need to, take some things out and  add others, and arrange your paragraphs.
Evaluation
Share your work with someone. This person could be your teacher, a friend or  parent, a classmate, or others in a writers' workshop. Collect valuable  information about what works and what doesn't work in your report.
Editing and Rewriting
Now that you have some fresh ideas, go over your work again. Correct any  spelling or grammatical errors you might have missed before; add any ideas you  got from others that you liked. Make a final copy of your writing.
Publishing
When others are able to read your finished product, you have published. Your  work may appear on a bulletin board, in a class book, in your own book, in a  portfolio, or in a newsletter.
Evaluation
In this stage, your teacher or your classmates will let you know what they  think of your report. Your teacher will evaluate your report to make sure you  completed it according to the directions given to you.
Basic Book Report Writing Essentials
For a Fiction Book
Include the title and author's name. Don't forget your own name as the author  of the book report. 
Compose a theme statement. This will really impress your teacher. The theme  is the main idea of the story. To help you figure out what the theme is in your  book, ask yourself these questions:
What does the main character learn by the end of the book? What is the  author's purpose in writing the book? Or, if someone asked you to quickly say  what the book is about, what would you say?
Summarize the story. This is writing about the plot. The summary is different  from the theme because in the summary you tell what happens in the story,  especially what happens to the main character. Be sure you have a beginning, a  middle, and an ending in your summary, just as you would in a story.
Give your opinion. End your book report by saying whether or not you liked  the book and whether or not you would recommend it to your friends to read. 
For a Nonfiction Book
Include the title, author's name, and your name.
Compose a theme statement. For a nonfiction book it might be, The author  wanted to show that spiders are fascinating and are not to be feared.
Summarize. Cover the topics as listed in the table of contents. Give a few  details for each, perhaps interesting things you learned.
State your opinion. In addition to stating whether or not you liked the book,  think about the following: Did the author provide the information you expected  to find? Was the writing interesting and easy to understand? Did you learn  anything new?

"Title: Action Words
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Oral Language, Listening, Speaking
Objective: Students learn about verbs.
Directions: Introduction
Through informal activities and class discussion, first and second grade students should come to understand that a verb is a word that expresses an action. Children at this age might find it more accessible to use everyday terminology, such as doing words or action words.

Children need to develop an awareness of the following types of verbs and their uses.
(a) Doing verbs are words that express a concrete action. They are common in spoken language and in the writing of young children. 
 Examples:  work, run, sit, eat, jump

 (b) Saying verbs express a spoken action.
 Examples:  talk, tell, said, suggested, yelled

 (c) Some verbs do not express a concrete action--they express actions that happen mentally, such as feelings, ideas, thoughts, or attitudes. These can be called thinking and feeling verbs. They are common in arguments, narratives, and descriptions (but not scientific descriptions, which are objective).
Examples: I like Sam.  I understand.  Katy believed the story.  
                    I see the rabbit.  I think people should recycle.

 (d) Some verbs tell us about what things are and what they have. These are being and having verbs. They are common in all kinds of descriptions. 
Examples: Ben is a good swimmer. Ali has the answer. They are here.
(Is, are, has, and have can also act as auxiliary or helping verbs for doing, thinking, and feeling verbs. Example: Ben is swimming.)
A verb is the key around which a sentence is built, and children need to be shown the importance of choosing the most expressive verb when speaking or writing. 
At this level, children should also be given constant informal practice in the correct use of certain verbs which are often misused.

 Examples:
went--gone
may--can
seen--saw
swim--swam
did--done
broke--broken
came--come
learn--teach
was--were
sing--sung

 Teaching Strategies 
Get active
Call for volunteers to perform certain actions and then describe what they are doing. Write what they say on the chalkboard and have other children underline the word(s) that expresses the action. I am jumping on the spot. I am hitting the door.

 Mime time
Have selected children mime certain actions and challenge the rest of the class to guess what they are doing. Write the guesses on the chalkboard and have children underline the words that express the actions. Are you sweeping the floor? Are you milking a cow?

 Verb list 
Provide children with a suitable noun and then have them add a number of verbs saying what that noun does. A snake bites and hisses. A horse gallops and neighs.

 Vague verbs 
Have students suggest more descriptive synonyms for certain verbs such as walk. Make lists to post in the classroom so students can refer to them while they are studying verbs and composing sentences.



walk
run
say


stroll
trot
exclaim


limp
race
whisper


shuffle
lope
snarl




 Correct it 
Tell children a sentence with an incorrect use of a verb. Have them orally correct it.
The boys have went.The boys have gone. Can I get a drink, please?May I get a drink, please?

 Verb match
Create two sets of labels--one set with names written on them, the other with matching verbs. Attach the labels to the chalkboard and have children sort them into matching pairs.



dogs
bark


cats
purr


elephants
trumpet


frogs
croak




 Picture search 
Have children search through old magazines and newspapers to find pictures in which an action is taking place. Then have them paste the chosen pictures on a large sheet of paper and beside each picture write a sentence describing the action. The lady is driving the car. The man is hitting the golf ball.

I can 
Ask children to demonstrate what they can do, describing it aloud as they do it.
I can hop.
I can jump.
I can read.

Distribute the Verbs activity sheets to students and have them use what they have learned to complete them.

"Title: A Tale of Two Towns
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Social Studies, Geography
Objective: Students compare their community and region with others.  Students describe places, cultures, and communities in the United States and compare them with those in other regions and countries.  Students locate information using people, books, audio/video, recordings, photos, simple maps, graphs, and tables.  Students locate information about local, state, and national communities using a variety of traditional sources, electronic technologies, and direct observations.
Directions: Description
In this lesson, the students will gain and apply knowledge of life in their own community and compare specific aspects of it to life in other communities.  They will work in small groups to fill out a questionnaire about life in their community, and email it to e-pals in other communities.  They will take digital pictures of important places in their town, and request their e-pals do the same if possible.  The culminating activity will be an oral group presentation of the information received from their e-pals, and a comparison of this information to the information they gathered about their own town.
As part of a social studies curriculum, the students study their community and how the community helps us to meet our basic needs.  The class also gathers information about other communities around the country to see how they compare with ours in terms of how basic needs are met.  Print materials, such as textbooks, are outdated so quickly, and this method of getting information is guaranteed to stay current year after year.   Also, the information in textbooks is presented from an adult's point of view.  Communicating with peers gives them information from a child's point of view, and really engages the students.  It encourages them to explore the connections and relationships between their town and the one the e-pals live in, and also the connection between them and their own community.  Along with enjoying the study of the community, the addition of the peer communication via the Internet adds an extra dimension that really generates excitement and meaningful conversations.
Preparation
Review basic map reading.  If possible, go on a field trip around town, and work with parents and other adults in the community to find the answers to the questions on the All About Our Community questionnaire sheet.  Students will then email the questionnaire to their selected e-pals to answer and return.  On the town field trip , children can take digital photos of important places, and include them in the mailing to their e-pals.  They can post them on the class web site, along with a narrative of each important place.  This helps to foster feelings of connection to the project and the community.  When the questionnaire is returned, the group of students who received it prepare a presentation for the class.  When they are preparing the presentation, they will use the scoring rubric to guide them in their preparation.   While students work on the presentation, encourage them to engage in conversations with their group about the information they have received, and the things they have learned about their own town.  These conversations will help to build an improved and shared understanding of the topic.  They will make connections between the things they have learned and how it affects their lives.
Set up e-pals for the students.  Below are some suggested websites for connecting your students with students around the country.
Step-by-Step Teacher and Student Instructions
The first lessons should focus on the history of your community.  Use any materials you have available to you including any special guests you can invite to share their knowledge with you.  After the completion of the history piece of your community, introduce the concept of basic needs, and discuss how people in your town used to meet their needs, and how their needs are being met in the present day.
Take the field trip through the community to see important places.  Take digital pictures.
The students now should be prepared to start filling in the questionnaire about the community they live in.  This should be done with their small group, and some brainstorming of possible sources of information should be done with the whole group.  The students might need to take the sheet home to consult with parents or other family members.  Groups will be heterogeneous and teacher selected, consisting of 4-5 students.
The students should make initial contact with the group of e-pals they have selected (or the teacher has selected for them).  They should send a copy of their completed sheet about their own community and a blank sheet to be filled out by the group of students in another town.
While they are waiting for the reply, the group should find the community on the map.  They should also get started on the visual aid for the presentation.  This will require a little research by the group.  The visual aid will be a poster showing the city/town placement within the state, and include the information that the students gather.  Suggested information for the poster, along with the map: highlights of the town, nickname/logo, pictures of things that are grown and or manufactured there, interesting historical facts, fun things for kids to do, population.  If the e-pals send photos of their town, these will be included in the visual aid also.
When the group receives the reply, they will need to meet and prepare the oral presentation, and add any new information to the visual aid.
Each student in the group will fill out the rubric to be sure they have met all the requirements, then present the oral report to the class.
Assessment/Evaluation
Fill out the rubric for each of the group members as they do their oral presentations.  They will also be evaluated on the accuracy of the information included in the questionnaire they fill out regarding their community.  The students will be encouraged to discuss the differences between the two communities and give some reasons why they think there are differences.  Both large and small group discussions to reflect on the differences will be facilitated as the information is received from the e-pals.  Take anecdotal notes as groups work together.  
Extensions
The students could continue to communicate with their e-pals to discuss other aspects of life in their community.  The community questionnaire along with the digital pictures taken from the field trip could be attached to the class web page.  More information could be included with the pictures.  The community study/comparison could be extended to include towns outside of the United States.  Parents could be asked to supply the email addresses of family members in other states instead of using the suggested web sites.

"Title: African Mask
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Social Studies, Art, Mediums
Objective: Students create masks that represent African culture.
Directions: Introduce to students the following background information about African art and the use of masks:
African art extends from ancient times to the present day.  The oldest works of art are rock painting and engraving that dates to 6000 B.C.  African art reflects the cultural diversity of the continent's ethnic groups and gives expression to the rich histories, philosophies, religions, and societies of the people.  Among the traditional types of African art are sculpture, furniture, pottery, textiles, and jewelry. 
Each individual ethnic group has its own traditions regarding both the subject and form of representation.  Some cultures value naturalistic representations while others favor abstraction.  Materials used in art are determined by their availability in each region and include wood, fiber, metal, ivory, clay, earth, and stone.
The African people often use masks as part of their celebrations.  The masks are made from a variety of materials and range from simple designs to ornate wood carvings.  The subject may be an animal or a mythical being.  Many people in other countries collect these masks as works of art.
Masks are a very important part of African culture.  Each mask has its own purpose.  Some are worn as ornaments while others are used in religious ceremonies.  Dancers wear them to communicate with spirits.  The spirits express themselves through the masks.  African masks are made of many different kinds of materials.  They are decorated with simple, strong, and powerful shapes and designs.  Doctors wear the masks to concentrate the healing powers of nature.
Before students begin creating their masks, reproduce the Make an African Mask patterns onto white construction paper.
Have students cut out the top and bottom patterns of the mask.  They should cut the slits for the forehead, chin, and cheeks.
Have students overlap the sides of each slit and staple or glue them back together to create a three-dimensional effect. 
Students can then cut out geometric shapes to create the facial features and other designs for the mask.  The eyes, nose, and mouth should be exaggerated to show their importance.
If desired, use raffia fibers or shredded cornhusks for hair.
Resources: 
, brown, gray, black, or beige construction paper (for decorating mask), 
, two 8 inch x 11 inch (20 cm x 28 cm) sheets of white construction paper per student (for mask pattern), 
, pencils,

"Title: Amazing Animals of Mexico
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students learn about different animals of Mexico.
Directions: Read and discuss the following paragraphs with the students.  Then, have them complete pages 84 and 85.
Beautiful butterflies, colorful birds, mischievous monkeys, and deadly snakes live on the varied landscapes of Mexico.  The jaguar was a symbol of power to the Aztecs, and the colorful birds gave their feathers for the traditional costumes.
One of the great, mysterious attractions in Mexico is the migration of millions of Monarch butterflies to the eastern part of Michoacan.  No one understands why the butterflies make this journey each year, but it is a beautiful sight as millions of orange and black wings flutter through the air.
Iguanas and Gila monsters are two of the lizards that live in the desert areas of Mexico.  You can often see children selling iguanas by the roadsides in the country, but stay away from the Gila monsters because they are poisonous.  Other desert animals include coyotes, lizards, prairie dogs, and rattlesnakes.
Spider monkeys and parrots like to live in the tropical forests where there is an abundance of trees.  The spider monkey winds its way through the branches like a professional acrobat, and can sometimes be a pest if you are eating food nearby.  The parrots have brightly colored feathers that make them easy to see in the green foliage.  Macaws also live in the tropical forests.  The quetzal bird has long, brightly colored feathers that the Aztecs used for their ceremonial costumes.  Unfortunately, the quetzal is becoming very rare.
One peculiar animal that lives in the jungle areas is the peccary.  This funny-looking animal is a type of wild hog, and is called a javelina in Spanish.  Ringtail cats also enjoy the jungle areas for hunting.  Other cats that live in the Mexican jungles are ocelots, jaguars, and margays.
The dolphin and starfish can be found in the ocean areas of Mexico.  Dolphins like to play off the shore, diving and swimming in the clear waters of the Pacific.  Gray whales are sometimes also sighted off the shores of Baja California.  Many other sea fish live near the Mexican shores and make fishing a big industry for the country.
The interesting and varied animal life of Mexico is as fragile as life anywhere.  Much of the wildlife is disappearing as the land is developed for logging, farming, and industry.  A blight along the coast of the Caribbean has claimed many of the palm trees, which are a natural habitat for the parrots and macaws.  Logging is changing the migration patterns of the butterflies.  Ecology is very delicate, and we must all work to protect our planet and the animals that live here.
Distribute the Amazing Animals of Mexico activity sheets and have students complete the activity.  If time permits, have them color the pages after they have finished gluing the pictures of the animals.

"Title: Computer Activities: Countries of the World
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Science and Technology, Social Studies, Geography
Objective: Students will use their research skills to learn about countries of their choice.  They will use their understanding of a computer graphics program to create at least two slides.  They will demonstrate their ability to save and retrieve information from their disks.
Directions: Each student selects a country and then researches the following aspects about the country:

the capital city
the flag
language(s) spoken
the country's continent
fun facts


After the students finish their initial research, have each student create two slides about his/her country.  The first slide must name the country and illustrate the flag.  The second slide shows the map outline of the country, lists the continent on which the country is located, and indicates where the capital is located.  Finally, have the students draw pictures on their second slide that show what makes each country well known.  Teachers can have the students plan their pages before going on the computer by using the Countries Templates activity sheets.
Each student should have his or her own disk on which to save the created slides.  The students should print copies of their slides so that the teacher can edit the slides.  
The teacher should then provide a schedule for compiling the slides into one class slide show. Organize the students into small groups according to the continents where their countries are located, and then load the slides continent by continent.
As the students load their two slides, they can record their voices explaining what the slides depict and choose transitions between slides.  Don't forget to view the entire slide show with the class!
Extension
This activity could be accelerated so that the students create more than two slides relating to their countries.  A further modification would be to have the students create a slide for each of the seven continents.  These could then serve as transitions between sections of the slide show.  A student could also create a mini slide show of numerous slides highlighting a specific country.

"Title: Everybody Needs
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Oral Language, Listening, Speaking, Science, Life Science, Social Studies
Objective: Students recognize basic necessities of life.
Directions: Discuss with students what they think the basic necessities of life are.  Ask them what they need in a day in order to survive.  Talk about what makes some things (like food) necessary for existence and others (like television or video games) luxury items.
Begin making a list of necessities.  This activity can be easily done as a small-group project.  Each group makes its own list and then compares it with the whole class.  Tell students to be sure that they know why they chose each item on the list.  Ask them how this list might change if they lived in another country.  Continue with a discussion as to whether needs might change from culture to culture.
Ask students the following questions:  Because somebody is different, does that make him or her wrong/right or better/worse than you?  Why?  We need to repect each other's differences, so how can we show respect . . . in the classroom? . . . on the playground? . . . at home? . . . with a neighbor? . . . with a person from another culture?  How would you like to be treated?
Ask students to talk about how they would feel if they were transported into a country where they didn't know anyone and could not speak the language.  How could someone help them to feel better?
Distribute one copy of the Everybody Needs book page to each student.  Have them fold the page in half at the dotted line and use crayons or colored pencils to illustrate the cover.  Then have them write on the inside the things they feel that everybody needs.

"Title: Famous African Americans Minibook
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students learn about famous African Americans.
Directions: Discuss with students the origins of African American history month.  In 1926, a scholar named Carter Woodson felt that African Americans did not know about the achievements of their collective past.  He instituted Negro History Week as a time to learn about and celebrate these past achievements.  In 1976, this celebration became a month-long one, and is seen as a time to reflect on achievements and contributions that may still be too little known. 
Ask the students to define prejudice and explain what it means to them.  Talk about some reasons people might be prejudiced (fear, ignorance, echoing parents' sentiments, etc.).  Discuss ways that people can overcome their prejudices--learn about others, discuss fears, cooperate with others, etc.
Introduce to them some of the famous African Americans found in the minibook.  Discuss with them many of the obstacles that these famous African Americans had to overcome, and the differences that they made to the world.

"Title: Famous Figures in History Minibook
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Social Studies, United States History, World History
Objective: Students learn about famous people in US history.
Directions: Introduce the concept of ""fame"" to your students as being the condition of someone who is well-known, usually for doing something exceptional.  Discuss with your students what might make a person famous.  Depending upon the age and prior knowledge of your students, you may need to discuss what ""history"" means.
Begin to make a list of famous people in history that your students know.  Add to the list each day during your thematic study.  Guide children in thinking of present-day famous people and heroes.  Current athletes, musicians, authors, and actors may enter your list of famous figures today.
Introduce students to some of the people from My Book of Famous Figures in History.  Have them try the following activities.

Work with your students to imagine what their lives would be like if they could not see.  Have student volunteers wear blindfolds for a few minutes.  Have other students press their ears closed so they cannot hear for a few minutes.  (Be sure that students are safe during this simulation time.)  Show students a sample of Braille writing and sign language, both of which were used by Helen Keller.  Explain that people who are deaf can ""hear"" music by feeling vibrations of musical instruments.  Use a variety of drums to have students experience the vibrations.
Since Einstein was curious about a compass and magnetic fields when he was a child, provide your students with hands-on experiences using a compass and using magnets.  Play a recording of some classical violin music (or have an older student come into your classroom to demonstrate how to play the violin).  Emphasize that Einstein was an accomplished violinist.


Extensions

Lead your students in a discussion to think of ways in which they might become famous.  The possibilities are endless!
Guide your students in writing an essay entitled ""How I Will Become a Famous Figure in History.""  Encourage students to think of their interests to guide them in their writing.

"Title: Fire Safety
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Physical Science, Social Studies
Objective: Students learn about fire safety and fire fighting equipment.
Directions: This lesson can take place over a week to coincide with a safety week or Fire Prevention Week or can be taught as a separate social studies unit.  Begin by discussing some general fire facts with students.  This is designed to be an oral exercise to establish a general base of information.  See what the students do not know and give them the information that they do not have.  Expand on and discuss the different ideas for reinforcement.
Controlled fire is one of humanity's best friends.  Primitive people used fire for heating, cooking, turning clay into pottery, and light.  Except for furnishing light, fire is used by people today for much the same things.  Fire also furnishes the energy for running steam engines and other machines.  It is used to separate metals from their ores and for many chemical processes.
Uncontrolled fire is one of humanity's worst enemies.  Fires have caused many deaths and billions of dollars in property damage in the United States.  Some fires are brought about by natural causes.  Lightning often starts forest fires.  Some fires are caused by carelessness, and others are set on purpose.

Safety Walk
Distribute a copy of your school map to each student.  Take a walk around your school and note the position of fire alarm boxes, fire extinguishers, and fire hydrants.  Have students mark all these on their maps.
When you get back to the classroom, pool all of your information and make one good copy of the map.  Run off enough copies to give to the school office and for each classroom in the school to post for their information and safety.
Give some consideration to discussing the serious offense of giving a false alarm.  Most schools have very severe penalties for this kind of misbehavior, and students should be warned ahead of time of the consequences of pulling such a prank.

Safety Plan
Have students draw a sketch of the floor plan of their homes, indicating doors and windows and second stories if they have them.  If they live in apartments or condominiums, have them show stairways and attached buildings.
Send these sketches home with students so they can discuss them with their parents and make family plans for escaping from a fire.

Safety Posters
Have students create fire prevention posters.  Remind them to think of good slogans and use simple, bright pictures and big letters.  Put the posters up around the school.
Fire Fighting Equipment
Distribute a copy of the Fire Fighting Equipment activity page to each student.  Have them do research to find out about each kind of engine.  Then they can color the engines.  If time permits, have them draw lines and labels to identify the different equipment on the fire engines.

"Title: Fun with Braille
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students will participate in group activities using the Braille alphabet.
Directions: Braille Flashcards
Create a set of Braille flashcards to assist your children in learning the Braille alphabet, using white index cards.  On one side of each index card, draw the necessary dots to represent each letter.  Then write the actual alphabet letter on the back of each card.  Place the set of cards in a learning center for children to use during free or planned center time.
Who Is It?
Write each child's name on an index card in Braille.  Place the index cards in a basket.  Have a child randomly choose a card from the basket and decode the Braille letters to read the Braille name.  The child whose name is on the card is then the next child to choose an index card.  (If a child chooses his or her own name card, he or she simply puts the card back in the basket and chooses a new card.)
Books in Braille
Many school districts have collections of books in Braille for blind children.  Show several Braille books to your children and allow them to use their fingertips to ""read"" the letters on the pages.  If possible, invite a child or adult with moderate to severe blindness to visit your classroom to read a Braille book to your children.
What's My Reward?
Challenge children to read sentences in Braille.  On each of the sentence strips, write sentences using Braille dots that refer to a reward-oriented activity.  Allow a child to choose a prepared sentence strip, decode the sentence, and if decoded correctly, receive that written reward.  Some possible rewards are the following:

Take free time to draw a picture.
You get to choose a sticker.
Read a book with a friend.
You have earned time on the computer.
You may visit the library.
You get to be the class helper today.
You will be the line leader today.


Create Your Own Message
For this activity, each child needs a pencil, a sentence strip, and a bottle of white glue.  Have each child think of a message that he or she would like to write in Braille.   Have each child lightly print the message, using Braille dots on the sentence strip.  Next, the child creates each word by squeezing small dots of glue on the penciled dots.  When the glue has dried, the children can trade their sentences to see if they can read each other's messages.

"Title: Gwendolyn Brooks
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Social Studies
Objective: Students will learn about a woman poet in honor of Women's History Month.  They will write poems inspired by the style of Gwendolyn Brooks
Directions: Gwendolyn Brooks was born in Kansas in 1917, with what she has described as two handicaps: she was both female and African American.  Yet, even as a child she was determined to succeed.  She began to write and send her poems to various publishers.  At eleven, she was a published poet!  Gwendolyn received almost no encouragement from her teachers and instructors, but she continued to write.
After the publication of her first book in 1945, Gwendolyn became a recognized writer.  The American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Guggenheim Foundation gave her grants and fellowships.
In 1949 Gwendolyn wrote the book Annie Allen, which describes a young girl's growing up and the many problems she faces.  Annie Allen earned Brooks something no other African American woman had ever earned: the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry; Columbia University in New York has presented this award each year since 1922.  Only five women--none of them African American--had ever received the award.  This was a remarkable achievement for Gwendolyn Brooks.
Gwendolyn Brooks wrote shape poetry.  Introduce this type of poetry to students.  Shape poetry is when your poem is written inside the shape of the object about which you are writing.  The lines do not have to rhyme.  Choose an object from nature.  (Brooks wrote one poem about rain.)  You might choose a snowflake, a raindrop, or even a plant or an animal.  Draw an outline of that object, and fill in the outline with your thoughts.
Distribute the activity sheet to students and have them try writing their own shape poems.

"Title: Hanukkah
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Social Studies, Art, Mediums, Techniques
Objective: Students will learn about the history of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.
Directions: Background Information
The Jewish festival of Hanukkah, or Chanukah, is also called the Festival of Lights.  It lasts for eight days and usually occurs in December, although in some years it may start in November.  It commemorates not only the triumph of the Maccabees over the great army of the Syrian king, Antiochus IV, in 165 B.C., but also the universal message that all people have the right to be free.
After the Jews won their battle, they went to their temple and found that the Syrians had brought in statues of their own gods.  The eternal light had been allowed to go out.  The Jews rekindled the light, but they had only enough oil to keep it burning for one day, and it would take eight days for a messenger to get more oil.  The miracle of Hanukkah is that the oil kept burning for eight days, long enough for the messenger to return with more.  Jews use a candleholder called the menorah to symbolize this miracle.  It holds nine candles.  One, the shammash, is used to light the others.  They stand for the eight days that the oil kept burning.
Hanukkah is celebrated by lighting the candles of the menorah, playing games of chance with a spinning top called a dreidel, and eating special holiday foods such as potato pancakes called latkes.  Children often receive a gift on each night of Hanukkah in addition to Hanukkah gelt (money).  This gelt sometimes consists of chocolate wrapped in gold foil to look like money.
Activities
Give a Hanukkah party in your classroom.  This can be very simple or very festive, but it should include at least one traditional food, some gelt, a chance to play the dreidel game, and the singing of some Hanukkah songs.  You can give one yourself with the help of a Jewish delicatessen.  Gelt can be purchased everywhere in its little net bags.  Directions for playing the dreidel game can be found below.  Read Hannukah stories.  Have children make Hanukkah hats to wear for the party.  Buy inexpensive plastic dreidels for your students or have each student make his or her own.
Beautiful Hanukkah cards can be made easily.  Fold blue paper into a card shape.  Lay the cut-out shape of a candle on the front of the card.  Lightly sponge thin white tempera paint over the entire front.  Carefully lift away the candle.  Allow to dry and write a message inside.  
Let children make a menorah using frosting and marshmallows.  Give each child a piece of tagboard 11 x 4 inches (28 cm x 10 cm), ten marshmallows, and nine candles.  Have the children spread some white frosting on the bottom of each marshmallow and then put them onto the tagboard.  With the frosting, ""glue"" a second marshmallow on top of the middle marshmallow to create the shammash or servant.'  Poke birthday candles into each marshmallow to create a menorah.
See the activity sheets for three other fun Hanukkah activities:  drawing a menorah, making a Star of David, and making a hanging dreidel
Directions for the Dreidel Game
Cut out the dreidel.  Make holes as shown below.  Fold along the inside lines to make a box.  Fold the tabs inward.  Use glue or tape to hold the dreidel together.  Push a pencil or pen through the holes.  Spin the dreidel and begin play.
To Play the Game
The dreidel is a four-sided spinning top.  The letters written on the side of the dreidel are Hebrew for A Great Miracle Happened There.  Each symbol represents a different instruction for the game.  To play, give each person a designated number of markers (gelt, candy, nuts, etc.)  Each player puts one marker in the center, or kitty, each time the dreidel is spun.  Players take turns spinning the dreidel.  
If the dreidel lands on:

"Title: Make a Washington Monument
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students learn about a national monument.
Directions: Give students some background information about the Washington Monument:
The Washington Monument is located at the end of the National Mall, near the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.  It was built to honor George Washington, who was the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797.  It took nearly a century for the idea of this monument to become a reality.  The United States government was slow in finding money for the monument, so a group of private citizens in the 1830s raised the money to bring their dream to life.
The cornerstone of the monument was laid in 1848 with the same shovel Washington had used in 1793 to lay the cornerstone of the Capitol Building.  Construction on the Washington Monument took a long time.  Political tensions, lack of money, and the Civil War were responsible for several holds on the building process.  The monument was finally completed in 1884.
The Washington Monument is made of stone.  A pyramid made of aluminum sits on top of it.  The monument was modeled after a classic Egyptian obelisk.  At 555 feet (169 m) tall it is one of the tallest masonry structures in the world.  The inner walls of the monument are made of marble.  There are 896 steps leading to an observation room at the top.  Here, visitors can look out windows and see the Lincoln Memorial, the Capitol Building, the White House, and the Jefferson Memorial.

"Title: Telegraphy
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students learn about a different method of communication.
Directions: Telegraphy
Guglielmo Marconi invented wireless telegraphy in the late 1800s, but it was in 1901 that he was able to send radio signals through the air over great distances.  Marconi had studied sound waves for many years.  He created the wireless telegraphy and was successful in sending radio waves across the Atlantic Ocean, a distance of more than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers).  The messages that Marconi sent were in Morse code, a method of communication using dots and dashes or short and long clicking sounds which represent letters of the alphabet.

Communication Web
Ask your students to think about the ways people communicate today.  How do we send messages to people we know?  How do we gather information about people and events in other countries?  Create a communication web by drawing a large circle labeled ""Communication.""  Draw lines radiating from the circle and at the end of each line, write a different form of communication we use in daily life, such as the telephone, the television, the radio, letters, newspapers, and magazines.
Impact of the Invention
Ask your children to share why they think the wireless telegraphy was an important invention.  How did people communicate before this invention?
How Radio Waves Work
Demonstrate to your students how radio waves behave with the following activities:

Tie a length of rope to a stationary pole (such as a tetherball pole).  Holding the free end of the rope, manipulate it so that the rope continually moves in an ""S"" shape.
Line up six croquet balls (one behind the other) for this experiment.  Hit the end ball with a croquet mallet.  Observe how the ball at the opposite end moves off while the others stay in place.
Fill a shallow pan with water.  Drop a marble into the center of the pan and watch the waves ripple outward from the center of the water.  This can also be done by placing a clear glass or plastic pan of water atop an overhead projector.  All children will be able to see the water ripples on the screen.


Sound Investigations
Have children work in pairs to investigate sound.  Give them the following directions:

Find out which travels faster, light or sound.  How fast do they travel?  How fast do radio waves travel?
Conduct experiments to find out if sound can travel through water, walls, tables, soft materials, etc.  Record your results and share your findings with your classmates.
Distribute the activity sheets to students.

"Title: Television
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students learn about the invention of television and discuss its role in their lives.
Directions: Background Information
In the late 1930s, the first television was demonstrated at the New York World's Fair.  During the 1940s, very few people owned television sets and very few programs existed.  However, by the 1950s, televisions existed in millions of homes and brought about tremendous changes in society.  Television changed the way people lived.  They stayed at home more and gathered around the TV for meals.  People were able to see firsthand a variety of events happening across the country.  News, events, and even advertising found their way into the homes of millions of Americans by the late 1950s.

Procedure
What's Good about Television?
There are many wonderful things about television and the programs it brings into our homes.  Provide each child with a copy of the television pattern on page 30 and have each child write thoughts about this invention.  Use some of the prompts below to inspire your children's writings.

What do you learn from television?
How does it help you learn about the world?
What programs do your family members like to watch?
How does the television affect your family?  Do you watch it together?  Does it cause arguments?
Write about your favorite programs.
Are there bad things about television?


Extension Ideas

Viewing Graph
Ask students to determine the number of hours each day that he or she spends watching television.  You may need to provide the children with program guides to help them determine the length of the shows they regularly watch.  Gather the information and create a class pie graph showing the number of hours spent in front of the TV..

What Can We Do?
Before the 1950s children did not have television to watch.  They participated in lots of other activities to fill their time.  Using magazine cutouts, have each child create a collage of activities that they can do for entertainment other than watching TV.

"Title: Thanksgiving Coupon Book
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students create coupon books in honor of the Thanksgiving holiday.
Directions: Before students begin the activity, discuss the history of Thanksgiving with them.
Thanksgiving was first observed by the Pilgrims in the year 1621.  The Pilgrims had just survived their first difficult winter in the new settlement near present-day Provincetown, Massachusetts.  The Pilgrims made friends with the Native Americans who taught them to build stronger houses and hunt for food.  When spring arrived, the Pilgrims went to work plowing the land and planting seeds brought from England.  One Native American, Squanto, became especially helpful to the Pilgrims.
When harvest time came, the Pilgrims discovered that they had more than enough produce to store for the next winter.  The Pilgrims were so grateful that they decided to hold a feast of thanksgiving, inviting their Native American friends.  The Native Americans brought shellfish, game, and wild turkeys.  The Pilgrims filled the tables with bounty from their gardens.  They all bowed their heads and said a prayer of thanks to God before beginning the feast which lasted three days.
Today, Thanksgiving is celebrated in America on the fourth Thursday of November.  Families gather together to share a special meal and to thank God for all the good that has been given them.
Distribute the Thanksgiving Coupon Book activity pages to students and tell them that the first Thanksgiving was characterized by a spirit of sharing and cooperation.  Have them create their coupon books to give to someone for whom they are thankful.
Additional Activities
Grouping Turkey Feathers: Buy a package of brightly colored feathers (found in craft stores).  Have children group the feathers that are alike in color.
Building Log Cabins: Build some log cabins for the Pilgrim family out of wooden building logs.  Make a Pilgrim family.  Stand up the characters to complete the scene!
Making Foam and Pipe-Cleaner Turkeys: Spray paint a foam ball brown.  Let dry.  Push in colored pipe cleaners for turkey feathers and feet.  (Remember to spray paint outside or in a well-ventilated area.)
Stringing Popcorn Necklaces: Provide each child with a needle and strong cotton thread approximately 20 "" (50 cm) long, and popcorn flakes.  Tie off the two ends of the thread when the necklace is long enough to go over the child's head.
Comparing Thanksgivings: Read a book that tells about the first Thanksgiving and the conditions under which the Pilgrims lived.  Make a Venn diagram or a chart comparing Thanksgiving then and now.
To emphasize a spirit of cooperation and good behavior, fill out a ""Thankful Certificate"" for each child.  The adult completes the award by filling in the page with a comment such as ""I am thankful that you were a good friend"" or ""I am thankful that your work showed improvement.""  The certificates are awarded at the end of the month and can be presented as part of a celebration feast.

"Title: Game: Turkey Put Together
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students play a game using a common symbol of Thanksgiving.
Directions: Discuss turkey parts and show a picture of turkey. 
 Game Directions:

Divide the class into two teams. This can be done by numbering off by 1s and 2s. As the children say their number, have them put that number of fingers up to remember which team they're on.
Give each player a turkey part. Each team should have enough parts to complete a turkey.
Have all the players on each team line up behind a starting line with their turkey part. (This can be drawn with chalk on the floor or rug.)
On the signal, ""GO!"" the first player in each line runs up and puts his/her turkey part on the flannel board, then runs back and touches the hand of the next team member. This continues until all members have had a turn and the turkey is complete. If the turkey is not put together correctly, the last member of each team needs to rearrange it so it will look like a turkey.
The first team to complete its turkey and have all players back in line is the winning team.

 Variations:
Leave the turkey parts out in a center and let the children take turns putting it together with a partner or by themselves.
Write the name of the turkey part on the back of each piece. Let the child put it together on the table or floor using the back sides with words facing up.
Mix up the parts of the two turkeys between the two teams and see if they can cooperatively put the turkeys together.

Objective: Students learn how to collect and organize data, create graphs, and use graphs to intepret data.
Directions: Preparation:

Reproduce the three bar graphs (pages 43-45) for students.  Three graphs are provided to give students the opportunity to sort pasta patterns by color, size, and type.
Reproduce the table (page 6), making three copies for each student.  You may also wish to make an overhead transparency of it to model how the data is recorded for each graph activity.
Reproduce the small, medium, and large pasta patterns (pages 41 and 42) on green, blue, red, and yellow paper or cardstock and cut them apart.  Make one set of pasta patterns for each small group or pair of students.  The number of each color, size, and type of pasta can vary.  Place the patterns in envelopes  or reclosable plastic bags, making all of the sets exactly the same.  If you prefer, students can use real pasta for these sorting activities.  To change the color of real pasta, place 15 drops of food coloring and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) rubbing alcohol in a container with a lid.  Shake the container.  Remove the colored pasta and allow it to dry.  The amount of food color affects the brightness of the color.
    Directions:

Divide the class into small groups or assign partners.  First have students sort the pasta into groups by color.  Ask them to count how many pasta pieces there are for each color (green, blue, red, yellow) and record the data on their tables.
Use the floor or wall graph to model the activity.  Show students how to mark the scale along the bottom, counting by ones or twos.  Help them place the bars on the graph.  Then ask them to record the results on their bar graphs (page 43), using colors that match the pasta groups.
Next have students sort the pasta into groups by size.  Ask them to count how many pasta pieces there are for each size (small, medium, large) and record the data on their tables.
Ask students to record the results on their bar graphs (page 44).  Discuss how to mark the scale on the left-hand side, counting by ones or twos.
Now have students sort the pasta into groups by type.  Ask them to count how many pasta pieces there are for each type and record the data on their tables.
Ask students to record the results on their bar graphs.  Show them how to mark the scale along the bottom, counting by ones or twos.
Discuss the questions (pages 43-45) and ask additional ones to check students' understanding.


    Extension Activities:

Teach students about probability, using the pasta patterns.  After determining the number of each color, size, and type of pasta, have students replace the patterns in the bags or envelopes.  Then have students make predictions about which color, size, and/or type of pasta is most or least likely to be drawn or which ones have an equal chance.
Create pictographs, using the pasta patterns (pages 41 and 42).
Have students make pasta salad for snack.  Be sure to ask parents if their children have any food allergies or dietary restrictions.

There are many methods that students can use to solve the problem.  They can act it out by giving another student seven pretzels and counting the rings as they hand out the pretzels.  They can draw diagrams on their activity sheets.  They can set out the pretzels on paper towels in front of them and physically count them.  They can even use the guess/check/revise method in which they make educatued guesses, find the solution, and then revise their earlier answers.  It is important to give students the opportunity to experiment with different strategies.
As your students work on the problem, ask them some questions to help them with their problem solving.  Try some of the following:
How did you reach that answer?
Can you use another strategy to solve the problem?
Can you write a problem that will produce the same answers?
Do you see a pattern?
Does anyone have the same answer but a different way to explain it?

"Title: How to Round Numbers
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Mathematics, Numbers and Numerations, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.)
Objective: Students learn to round numbers to the nearest tens, hundreds, and thousands.  They also use the concept of rounding in addition and subtraction problems.
Directions: Use the number line to introduce the idea of rounding.  Color the numbers 10-14 red and the numbers 15-20 blue.
Ask the children if the number 16 is closer to 10 or 20.  (The number is in the blue area so it is closer to 20.)  Do this with several different numbers to give the children visual practice with rounding.
Review the concept of place value, using the place-value mats and numbered index cards.  Give each child a set of index cards and a place-value mat.  Shuffle the cards and place in a stack facedown.  Take the top four cards, turn them over in order, and lay them on the place-value mat in the same order.

"Title: Shapes in Our World
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Mathematics, Geometry
Objective: Students classify shapes and identify them in everyday objects.
Directions: Introduce the following information about shapes to students.
How to Explore Plane Shapes
What are plane shapes?  Plane shapes are geometric shapes that have flat surfaces, such as a square, rectangle, circle, triangle, hexagon, trapezoid, octagon, etc.  Use the activities below to help describe, recognize, model, draw, and classify geometric plane shapes.
Classifying Plane Shapes
Look at pictures of plane geometric shapes.  Recognize the characteristics of each shape.  Count the number of lines/sides and angles/corners.  
A circle is round.
It has no sides.
It has no corners.

Discuss how some shapes are alike or different.
Practice drawing and cutting out these shapes to use as manipulatives.
Create word problems using the shapes like the example below.


A hexagon has 6 sides, and a triangle has 3 sides.
How many more sides has a hexagon than a triangle?
Create Shape Pictures

Cut out plane shapes or use pattern blocks or tangrams.  Practice fitting the sides together to form complex shapes and designs.
Use paper shapes to design patterns.
Examine quilts, clothing, etc. to see how the different shapes are arranged to form a design.


Geometry in the World

Look for geometric plane shapes in your home/neighborhood, on the TV/computer, at the store/park, etc.
Use magazines, newspapers, the Internet, etc. to find pictures with geometric shapes.  Cut them out and sort them by shape.
Use the pictures to make a ""shape mosaic,"" a large picture made up of smaller pictures.

"Title: Sorting Sweethearts
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Mathematics, Data Analysis and Probability
Objective: Students learn how to collect and organize data, create graphs, and use graphs to intepret data.
Directions: Creating Graphs
Graphing a type of food or food preference can be effective means of teaching students about graphs.  One method of graphing is to write a question on the board or on a poster.  The question should be written exactly as it appears on the student's paper.  Ask the students to create graphs using a variety of methods, depending upon what is most efficient in your classroom.  For example, if you have a white board, you may write the question and have each student use a dry-erase marker to graph the information that provides the answer.  If you use a chalkboard, you may write the question and provide students with sticky notes to use as data markers.  They can then write their names on their sticky notes, come up to the board, and place their votes on the class graph.  
Another effective method of creating a graph is to write the graph question on poster board or chart paper and have each student contribute to the graph by gluing on a piece of cut paper, coloring in the information on the graph, or using a sticky note to indicate a preference.  An overhead projector can also be used as a means of creating a graph and presenting results.  Students can actually contribute their data on an overhead transparency and share it with the class.
After data has been collected, students should transfer the information to their individual papers.  Once this is done, they need to communicate as much about the data as they can.  It is most beneficial to do several class graphs without paperwork prior to having the students use their pencils.  By doing this, students begin to develop vocabulary that can later be used to express their observations about the class graphs.  While discussing the results of the graph, use words like most, least, similar, total, difference, and conclusion.  This vocabulary becomes a natural part of their answers when they get used to hearing it.
You may want to delay providing the snack until immediately after the graph is finished.  Presenting the most popular snack according to the graph is one more way to show students the value of real-life information and how their decisions and votes do have an impact.
The way the information is represented is not as important as the interpretation of the graph data.
The key to graphing activities is to make them important to the students.  When students realize that graphing is another safe environment in which to communicate about math, their interest peaks.

"Title: Spooky Spiders: Multiplication Snack Activity
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.)
Objective: Students make sense of mathematical concepts by manipulating food items in order to solve a problem.  As they solve the problem, they develop their critical-thinking skills.
Directions: Show students the food you have brought and explain to them that they will be using this food to solve math problems.  Since students will be handling food, make sure that they wash their hands before participating in the activity.  It is also a good idea to check for allergies.
Strategies Students Use to Problem Solve
Using Math Snacks as a supplement to your current math curriculum will increase the use of problem-solving skills in your students' daily work.
Some problems lend themselves to one particular strategy, while others can be solved in a variety of ways.  Once students or groups of students become comfortable using one strategy, you may want to choose one of the following strategies to expand their strategy choices.
The following are methods that students may choose to solve the question for which they are seeking the answer.
Act It Out
Students can use the problem like a script and act out the question.  For example, they can actually hand out five candies to each person and see what happens.
Solve a Simpler Problem
Students can use smaller numbers or a less demanding equation to figure out their solution.  While recreating a problem, the student can look for number patterns.
Draw a Diagram
Students can draw a representation of the problem to help them visualize the process for solving.  This method seems to be the most common among primary students.  Their diagrams may take the form of a circle with tallies, or they may be actual pictures of grapes being crossed out to show subtraction.  Choose this method so they can see the relation between numbers and actual ""things.""
Make a Chart or Table
Students can create tables or charts to organize the pictures or number information.  Once they have the organization, the patterns they are seeking are sometimes more visible.  Many students prefer a blank graph sheet to help them arrange their data.  They may find it difficult to draw straight lines, so provide that paper for them if they need it.
Find a Pattern
By using numbers on their papers or numbers on the hundreds chart, students can look for patterns to help them come up with the next logical number in a sequence or pattern.
Make a Physical Model
Students may need to use actual manipulatives to solve and work through their problem-solving processes.  It is important to allow students to use whichever math tools they deem most beneficial.  Sometimes, it is the actual snack that can help the students the most when they are allowed the chance to manipulate it.
Guess/Check/Revise
Students are encouraged to make an educated guess at the possible outcome to the question.  They can then use what they already know about numbers to check their early attempts at solutions.  If it is necessary, they can revise their answers.  It is important to note that students may use several strategies to prove their solutions are either right or wrong.
Work Backwards
Sometimes the answer is in front of the students, and they need to work their way backwards to find the final solution to the questions they are trying to answer.  This is also a great technique to help students justify their answers by using a different strategy.
It is important that students have the opportunity to experiment with different strategies and that students are given the opportunity to communicate their efforts.  Every student can express his or her thoughts about mathematics.  Some students communicate with numbers, and others communicate with words.  The important consideration here is that students develop more critical thinking skills and the ability to reach and explain a viable solution to any problem-solving situation.  The activities in Math Snacks are designed to encourage this development.

Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students observe and collect data about ants in the wild.
Directions: Find a source of wild ants near school for students to observe.  Watch how they behave and try the various experiments which will be conducted with the students in this lesson.
During observations of the ants, you may consider having students use a piece of newspaper to sit on.  This will help those somewhat frightened by insects to feel more secure than just sitting on the ground.
Consider taking photographs of all students observing ants during this study. 
 Activity
Distribute a file card to each student and have each draw an ant from memory.  It should be as large as the file card to show details.
Take the students to an area near school to observe ants in the wild.  Have them watch ants moving, asking them to describe the movement.  (Usually ants move in a line, following a scent trail laid down by the earlier ants.)
Conduct some simple experiments with the ants so students can see how they react.

Draw a line through the line of ants so students can see how the ants react.  (The ants will become disoriented for a while but then find their way again.)  Let them watch to see how the ants reestablish the new trail.  Ask students to think what method the ants might have used to find their path again.
Place an obstacle (e.g., pebble) in the line of ants so students can watch and discuss their reaction.  (They may go around it or climb over it.)  See if they can guess why the ants behave in the manner they do.
Put food (pieces of meat, candy, seeds, sugar cereal) in the ants' path and observe how they react.  If they carry off the food, point out how much larger the pieces are than the ants.  Have students notice that ants use their mouths to hold the food. 
Let the students think of ways to study the ants and carry out their experiments.


Follow the ants' trail to find where it begins and ends.
 Closure
Return to the classroom and group the students.  Distribute the data sheets to the students and have them write illustrated stories about their observations of ants in the wild.

Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students understand that butterfly eggs come in a variety of sizes, colors, and shapes.
Directions: Tell students that butterfly eggs look different from any other type of egg.  They can be green, red, blue, yellow, or brown.  Some eggs are round like balls while others are shaped like little barrels, pancakes, or pickles.  Usually their shells are decorated with lines and dots that cannot be seen except with a magnifying lens.  The butterfly mother uses a natural glue to attach her eggs to a leaf or fasten them to a twig so that they will not fall to the ground.  Many butterflies lay one egg at a time while still others deposit hundreds of them side by side in neat rows.
Find a leaf.  Glue a small white bean to the leaf.  Show it to the children and explain that all butterflies start out as eggs on a leaf.  Tell the class that the butterfly mother always puts her eggs on a leaf that is her favorite food so that when her eggs hatch there will be plenty of food for her babies to eat.

When they open it, both sides should be exactly the same shape.  You may then assist children in putting drops of paint on one side.  When the butterfly is folded over, pressed together, and opened up, both sides will be the same pattern, showing bilateral symmetry.

"Title: Connecting Body Parts
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students will learn the names of external body parts and then create funny bodies.
Directions: Lesson Preparation
Make a transparency of body parts.  Color the eyes, hair, and clothing with a permanent felt pen.  Cut them out and place them in an envelope for safekeeping.
Make a set of these pictures for each student.
Activity
Ask the students to stand and play a body game with you.  Tell them that when you call out the name of a body part, they are to point to it.  Call these parts in the following order: head, arms, hands, chest, abdomen, legs, feet.  Call out the parts of the face for them to point to in the following order: eyes, nose, lips, and ears.
Change the game to check for comprehension by telling the students to give the name of the body and face parts you point to on your own body.  Have them point to this part on themselves and say its name.  Point out the body and face parts in order at first and then at random to be sure all know what the parts are called.
Distribute a piece of construction paper and the copies of the body parts to the students.  Write the names of the body parts (not face parts) on the board and have them label their pictures.  Let them color the eyes, hair, and clothing and then carefully cut them out, placing them on their construction paper as they do so.
Place the transparency pieces of the body and face parts on the overhead and ask two students to come up and assemble them.  Leave the overhead projector light off as they do this and have the students assemble their body and face parts on their construction paper.  Once all students have put their bodies together, turn on the overhead projector so they can see if they agree with the arrangement.
Turn off the projector light and tell the students that you are now going to make a new body from these parts.  Turn on the light to show what this funny figure looks like.  Tell them to rearrange their body parts to make a new body which is different from the one you did.  Encourage them to make each body different from their neighbor's so they can see how many different ways there are to rearrange the body.
Closure
Have the students glue the parts of the newly created bodies on the construction paper.  Place these on the bulletin board for them enjoy.

"Title: Echolocation
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students will learn about echolocation.
Directions: Background
Echolocation is the method that some bats use to catch insects and other moving creatures.  They are able to use sound waves to determine where the insect is.  When a bat is hunting it makes a series of high-pitched sounds.  The sound waves travel through the air and bounce off of objects.  When the sound waves return to the bat it can tell the bat where the object is.  A bat can use sound waves to tell the difference between objects that are stationary or moving.  For example, a bat uses sound waves to avoid hitting a tree and immediately afterwards uses sound waves to catch a mosquito.  Bats probably have the best techniques for echolocation of any animal on earth.  The sounds they make are often much higher than the human ear can hear.
How do sound waves travel back to a bat?  It is similar to how a mirror reflects light.  If you hold a small mirror in your hand and maneuver it in the sunlight you can see the light reflecting off of the mirror and onto other objects.  This is similar to how sound waves are reflected.  The bat emits a high-frequency sound.  The sound waves hit an object and are then reflected back to the bat.  This high-tech system allows bats to fly in total darkness.  They not only see where they are going, but can also catch their prey.  When you look at pictures of bats you can see that many have large ears and interesting nose shapes.  Some bats use their ears to catch sound waves and other bats use their odd-shaped noses to direct sound waves.
Activities

Provide your children with hand mirrors and take them outside on a sunny day.  Ask each child to reflect the sunlight off of the mirror and onto the sidewalk, side of a wall, or the school building.  Ask the child to think about how the mirror is reflecting the light.  Explain that bats reflect sound waves off of objects in much the same way.  (Note: Warn the children to not reflect the light directly back towards anyone's eyes or face.)
Gather the children around you and ask them to look at the size of their classmates' ears in comparison to their bodies.  Show pictures of bats with large ears and ask the children to compare the size of the ears to the bats' bodies.  Remind the children that megabats have small ears and microbats have large ears.  Scientists divide bats into two groups-megabats and microbats.  There are about 200 kinds of megabats and about 800 kinds of microbats.  Megabats have large eyes and excellent eyesight.  Most megabats have short, round ears.  Most megabats eat fruit and have a good sense of smell so that they can find ripened fruit.  They can have wingspans up to six feet (1.90 meters).  They roost together in trees and wrap their wings around themselves to keep warm.  Microbats are generally smaller than megabats with wingspans up to five inches (13cm).  They have large ears and small eyes.  Most microbats eat insects and use echolocation to hunt.  Their ears and noses come in a variety of shapes and sizes.
Are humans more like megabats or microbats?  Have the children cup their hands around their ears.  Continue talking to the children and ask if they notice a difference in the loudness of your voice.  Ask them to tell why they think the sound is louder.  Provide each child with a large paper circle (with approximately a 12 inches [30 cm] diameter) that has been cut in half.  Ask the children to cup one half-circle paper around each ear to form a pair of larger ears.  Talk to the children for a few minutes with their larger ears in place.  Be certain to not talk louder than when the children initially listened to your voice.  Ask them to share how you sounded to them this time.  Did your voice sound louder?  Explain to children that their enlarged ears were able to collect more sound waves which improves their hearing.
Complete the activity sheet about the bats' noses as a class.  Work together to match the names with the bat noses.  If necessary, you can use reference books or the Internet to find the answers.

"Title: Fun with Plants  Flower Power
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students will dissect flowers to discover where seeds originate.
Directions: Teacher Information
Some plants produce two kinds of flowers on the same plant.  One will have only stamens, the other only pistils.  These are incomplete flowers.  There are also composite flowers (such as dandelions and marigolds) which consist of many complete flowers clustered into one.  The flowers used for this activity should have both stamens and a pistil, known as a complete flower.  These include flowers like the lily, gladiola, tulip, and fruit blossoms.  Select the largest flowers for this lesson and provide a variety of them.
Activity
Ask the students if they know how seeds are produced.  Tell them they are about to take a flower apart so they can see where seeds are formed.  If the students are too young to dissect flowers alone, do this activity as a demonstration.
Distribute data sheets, flowers, magnifiers, and clear tape to students and let them follow the data sheets as they dissect the flower.
Closure
Use the transparency How Flowers Reproduce to explain the reproduction process to students.  Tell them bees are the best pollinators of flowers.  When a bee goes to a flower to get nectar and pollen, some pollen drops off the bee's body onto the sticky stigma on the pistil.  Beekeepers often rent hives to farms with apple orchards or other trees needing to be pollinated.  Other insects which visit flowers also pollinate them.  Pollen can also be transferred to the stigma by wind and by some birds and bats.
Explain that fruits and vegetables are really swollen ovaries of a blossom that grew on the plant.  Show students an apple and point out the leftover blossom and stem on opposite ends.  Cut the apple open to expose the seeds formed inside the ovary.  Let the students examine the seeds. 
Save the students' flower parts to be used in the next lesson and in the plant journal.
Extension
Take students on a walk to search for fruit-bearing plants that show blossoms and fruit.  Try to find examples of the transition from blossom to fruit on a plant.  Cut open a blossom to expose the swollen ovary inside, the beginning of the fruit.
Have students examine a dandelion flower and one which has gone to seed.  This is a great example of a composite flower.  Each seed is formed in its own flower but combined with others.

"Title: Identifying Matter by Sound and Feel
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Life Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students will investigate the physical properties of sound that matter can make.
Directions: Send home the parent letter and a film canister for each student a few days in advance of when you conduct the activities.
Put a number on each container, both on the lid and on the canister as they are returned.  Record each student's name and container number on the Sound and Feel Containers List.
Select 10 canisters to use and save the rest for later.  Make a random list of their contents as an answer sheet.
Students will then match the characteristics they sense when shaking the containers and copy the name of the item from the answer list beside the container's number.
Activity

Divide the students into small groups and then distribute a copy of the What's Inside the Container? Data Sheet to each group.  Divide the containers into sets for each group and distribute them on a tray.
Have the students carefully shake the containers to see if they can guess the contents.  The members of the group should come to agreement and then record their guess.
Rotate the containers on the trays to another group until all containers have been tested by each group.  It is important to allow enough time for each group to discuss the possibilities before recording their guess.
Monitor the students to be sure the lids are not removed.  Be certain that each member of the group is contributing to the test and discussion.

Closure
Have each group tell what they thought was in each container.  Record their guesses on the Sound and Feel Guess List transparency.

"Title: Let's Go Fly a Kite
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students use kites to study the wind.
Directions: Lesson Preparation
Using lightweight, easy-to-fly kites is one of the best ways to let children experiment with wind currents.  Although many patterns are available for homemade kites, inexpensive plastic kites work best for this activity.
Cut 50 feet (15 m) of string for each of the kites.  Tie one end to the center of the kite according to the instructions on the kite, and the other to the center of the plastic pipe.  Attach one kite to a string 200 feet (60 m) long.  (If possible, older students can assist in this activity.)
Activity

Take students to a large field.  Have them check the wind direction with the weather vane.  Look at trees to see how the wind is moving the leaves and branches.  Toss a handful of grass into the air so students can see the direction it blows.
Use the kite with the longest string to demonstrate how to fly a kite.  Just as the children will do, have another person hold the kite up and release it when you are ready to run.  When the kite is airborne, have students observe it move in the wind. 
Explain that it is now their turn to fly their kites.  Divide students into pairs in a line at one end of the field.  The partners should stand face-to-face.  The child who is to fly the kite will hold the pipe in one hand.  The partner will hold the kite high by the center stick.
At a signal, the child holding the kite releases it, and the other partner runs down the field, gradually letting out string so the kite will climb.  The other partner should run behind.  Both should watch what the kite is doing as the wind catches it. 
Have students practice in one part of the field to gain experience.  It is best to let only a few practice at one time.
After students reach the far end of the field, they should line up again.  This time, the other partner will get to fly the kite.
Provide time for students to observe their kites.

Closure
Return to the classroom and have students use page 16 to make a series of drawings showing how they flew their kites.  Have them write what they did to get the kite into the air and what helped to keep it up.

"Title: Mixing Colors
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Physical Science, Art, Mediums
Objective: Students discover the possible combinations which result from mixing primary colors.
Directions: Some objects, such as traffic lights and neon signs. appear colored because the light they give off contains a limited range of wavelengths.  Most objects appear colored because their chemical structure absorbs certain wavelengths of light and reflects others.  When white light strikes a banana, for example, it absorbs all other colors except yellow, which is reflected back to our eyes.  The light entering the eye falls on the retina that lines the back and sides of the eyeball.  Cells in the layers absorb the light and convert it to electrical signals.  These travel through nerves to the brain where they are interpreted as color.
To prepare for the lesson, make sets of six plastic cups for each group, labeled as follows: red + green, green + blue, blue + yellow, red + yellow, blue + red, and yellow + green.  Fill the cups nearly full of water.  For each group, make a tray of the following materials: set of six cups of water, labeled with colors; six toothpicks; paper towel; one green and one yellow crayon; and two blue and two red crayons.
(If the activity is too complex for this class, arrange for adults or older students to work with each group as needed.)
Show the students red, green, blue, and yellow food coloring and have them tell you the names of the colors.  Explain that they are going to use the food coloring in water and explain what they see happening.  Divide the students into small groups and distribute a tray of materials to each group.  Distribute a copy of the What Color Do You See? data sheet to each student and review it with them before they begin.
Divide the cups of water among the members of each group along with the food coloring and crayons which match the first color to be added to each cup.  Assign each member of  the group to do a different color combination in his or her cup of water, and then show the results to the other members so they can complete their records.
Have students compare the results of their experiments and complete the Color Chart work sheet as a culmination of the activity.  After they complete the chart, students will use the cups of colored water they just created and add the third color as shown in the equation.  To help them understand how to do this, have each group do the first combination as you monitor their progress.  They will need to add yellow to the red + green cup and green to the red + yellow cup and compare the new color before writing the answer to the equation.

Objective: Students will learn about the July 20, 1969, moon landing.
Directions: Background

On July 20, 1969, history was made when Apollo 11 took Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin (""Buzz"" Aldrin) on a journey to the moon.  They landed after five days of travel and were the first men to set foot on the moon's surface.  The world watched as the men stepped from the craft and heard Armstrong's words, That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

The astronauts collected samples of moon rock and soil.  They took photographs, performed experiments, and set up equipment that would be used to send information back to Earth.  This great event led to several more lunar orbits and opened the door to space travel and study of the solar system.

Peek-a-boo Rocket Book

Have students demonstrate their knowledge of the first moon landing by creating peek-a-boo rocket books.  To make a book, each student needs a copy of pages 41 and 42.  Have students cut out the patterns.  Glue the rocket top and bottom onto the center piece on the tabs and allow the glue to dry.  On the lines provided, ask students to write about the historic moon-landing event.  Then fold and crease on the dashed lines.  Students may color the rockets, as desired, to complete their projects.

Moon Rocks

Your students can make their own moon rocks with an easy-to-make dough.  To make the dough, mix together the ingredients listed above.

Knead the ingredients until the dough is smooth and pliable.  If the dough is too dry, add a bit more water.  If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour.  Add a few sprinkles of silver glitter, if desired.  Have each student mold a small portion of dough into an interesting rock shape.  Allow the rocks to dry on waxed paper for several days.

"Title: Seeing and Hearing Game
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Oral Language, Listening, Science, Life Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students will learn about the importance of different animal senses by acting out activities or making certain sounds
Directions: Preparations

Reproduce the See and Hear Cards onto tagboard.  Cut apart the cards, color, and laminate them for durability.  You will need to reproduce enough cards so that every child receives a card.
Reproduce the My Eyes, My Ears sheet, one per child.

Directions

Pass out one See or one Hear card to each child, face down.  Explain that the game is played by having them move around the room trying to find classmates with the same type (see or hear) of card.  Before they begin, be certain you explain that the children with Hear cards (animals or things) can make sounds or noises, but the children with See cards cannot make sounds, instead they must pantomime their pictured item.
Tell the children the signal to begin the game will be a seeing signal (dropping a piece of paper on a desk).  The signal to end the game will be a hearing signal (clapping your hands).  Begin by dropping the paper.  Hearing-card children will begin to make their appropriate sounds while the Seeing-card children will begin their pantomimes.
After about three to four minutes, clap your hands and have each group display their cards.  As a total class, decide if the groups have classified themselves (seeing or hearing) correctly.  Permit children input in this evaluation.
Have the children complete the My Eyes, My Ears activity sheet.  Be certain your children understand the concepts of up versus down, and loud versus soft, before completing this activity.

Note
As an extension, record familiar sounds (coughing, snoring, sneezing, telephone ringing, radio playing, car horn honking, etc.) onto a cassette tape.  Play the tape and have the children try to recognize the sounds.  Replay the tape and discuss each sound.

"Title: Shadows All Around Us
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will learn about where a shadow should fall based on the position of the sun.
Directions: Before the Computer

Read one of the books mentioned above to students or any book that addresses shadows.
Conduct a whole-class demonstration lesson on shadow casting.  This can be done in the early morning with the sun at a low angle or in a dimly lit room with a flashlight acting as the sun.  If desired, you can relate the time of day/position of shadows to the daily cycle of earth rotation and of the sun hitting the earth.
Allow the children, in small groups, to experience shadow casting on their own.
The students can work from the Shadows All Around Us planning sheet.


On the Computer

Create a template on the computer using the Template worksheet as an example.  Students could also create the worksheet (page 51) on their own.
Using the Shadow tool, cast a shadow in the proper direction based on the position of the sun.


Extensions

Allow the students to move the sun on the template and adjust the shadows for the new sun position.
Have the students create their own templates--a little differently!  Instead of determining which direction a shadow would be cast by looking at the position of the sun, the student could create shadowed objects, and have a classmate determine the position of the sun.
Pose the question--Would the shadows look the same at 10:00 in the morning on June 1st and December 1st?  Why or why not?
Would the shadows look the same in your town and in [choose a location in an opposite hemisphere at approximately the same longitude] at the same time on the same day?

"Title: Taste Buds
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students learn the location of different taste buds in their mouths.
Directions: 
Tell students that taste buds cover their tongues.  The interesting thing about a taste bud is that its location in the mouth determines how something will taste when that item touches the taste bud.  
Have students try this experiment to find the different locations.
Ask the students to sprinkle a little sugar on their tongues, paying attention to where the sugar is when they taste it.  This is where their taste buds for sweet foods are located.
Do the same with the remaining materials, one at a time.  Lemon juice will find their sour buds, salt will find their salt buds, and tonic water will find their bitter buds.
Have the students color the tongue pattern according to the directions on the page.
Have students cut out the mouth on the face pattern and insert the tongue through the mouth.  Then they can glue the tongue in place.

"Title: The Parts of an Insect
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: In this lesson the children will capture and examine various insects, discuss them, read about them, write about them, and, using draw software, print out their scientific and artistic interpretations of them.  Learning about the importance of insects to our environment will also help them understand why they should treat them with respect and release them when through with their research.
Directions: Into:  Before the Computer
Tell the children they are going to study live insects, and they need to bring one from home.  They need to put it in a jar with one little hole punched in the lid.  Or, you can take them out on the school grounds with jars and nets if you'd like.  They should not attempt to bring in bees or wasps, since they can sting.  Tell them they should not bring in spiders because they are not insects; they may already know this if the class has previously studied animal classification.
Using the research materials, they can attempt to identify their insects.  Have each child draw his/her interpretation of his/her insect, labeling its parts.
Through: On the Computer
The children draw their interpretations of their insects on the computer, label the parts, and print their drawings.  If appropriate, they can write sentences or paragraphs explaining the uses of the insect's parts.
Beyond: Extra Activities
The children also draw the habitats where they found their insects.  Display their pictures on a bulletin board where other classes can see them.  Staple the pictures together, design and laminate a cover, and assemble into an Insect Book.  Repeat this activity with the other animal classifications.  (Do not use live animal models for all; obviously, pictures will have to suffice for most.)  Allow each child to create his/her own book of Animal Parts.

"Title: Wind
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: 
In this section students make a simple instrument to measure the speed of the wind. 
use the instrument to record the wind speed over a number of days. 
construct a simple weather vane to measure wind direction. 
use the weather vane to record the wind direction over a number of days. 
investigate how the wind can be put to work. 
construct a simple machine that is powered by the wind.

Directions: Measuring the Wind 1 (Page 39)
The pressure of the air on the earth's surface is different in different places.  The  differences in pressure causes the movement of air or winds.  If a pressure difference exists, air moves from the higher pressure to the lower pressure area, in order to even out the pressure.  If the high pressure center is close to a low pressure center, the movement from the high pressure to the low pressure is faster and the winds will move faster.  The larger the pressure difference, the stronger the winds are.  Instruments such as anemometers or wind gauges are used to measure the speed and strength of the wind.
Measuring the Wind 2 (Page 40)
The direction of the wind is determined by the direction the wind is coming from and not the direction it is blowing to.  Instruments such as weather vanes and windsocks can measure the direction of the wind.
Wind Power (Page 41)
Using the wind for power is a good idea because it does not cause pollution.  In places that are very windy, wind farms are set up where a field full of windmills turn machinery that generates electricity.

"Title: Adjectives
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Grammar
Objective: Students learn about and practice using adjectives.
Directions: Introduction

Adjectives are words that tell us more about nouns or pronouns by describing them, adding detail, or refining their meanings. First and second grade students can refer to adjectives as describing words.By using adjectives, we can add meaning and interest to sentences.
Examples:
The kind girl showed the old lady the way.
The savage dog chased the frightened boy. 
The playful dog chased the laughing boy.
The rude girl shoved the disabled lady.

Children should be encouraged to think about the adjectives they choose and to steer away from adjectives that have become meaningless through overuse, such as ""nice"" and ""good.""
Examples:
It was a nice day. It was a sunny day.
That was a good story. That was an exciting story.

Like ""nice"" and ""good,"" these are also considered overused adjectives that should be replaced with more exact choices:  fine, grand, funny, awful, lovely, terrible, crazy, adorable, sweet, cool, cute.

Teaching Strategies
Describe the picture 
Display a large poster to the class. Have children orally describe the different objects and people featured in the picture.



 What color is the bird?   
 The bird is yellow.   


 What type of tree is it?   
 It is a big, shady tree.   


 What colors are the flowers?   
 They are purple and red.   




Character words 
After reading a story to children, ask them to provide describing words for the characters.
What kind of person was Cinderella?
What words could we use to describe the ugly stepsisters?
What adjectives will help paint a picture of the prince?
Describe the noun 
Have children suggest adjectives to describe nouns you have written on the chalkboard. Children could work in groups to compile lists of adjectives and then compare their lists with those of another group.



 dog   
 savage, big, friendly, black, loyal . . .   


 teacher   
 


 car   
 


 pupil   
 


 bike   
 





Follow the instructions:

Give children a piece of paper and have them follow your instructions to draw a noun modified by an adjective.
Draw a fat pig.
Draw a tall boy.
Draw a yellow roof.
Draw a happy girl.
Draw a fast boat.
Oral adjectives 
Challenge children to orally supply adjectives for nouns you have written on the chalkboard.
A teacher should be_____________ and _____________.
A football player should be _____________ and _____________.
Opposites 
Have children supply the opposite of an adjective you have given in a sentence.
An elephant is large but a mouse is . . .
A fire is hot but ice is . . .
A nice challenge 
Challenge children to create lists of adjectives that are more 
meaningful than ""nice"" or ""good."" These could be displayed around the classroom for future reference.

Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: The students will be able to write an adventure story that contains a title, as many sentences as you require*, and a conclusion.
*On the peer and teacher assessment sheets, the number of sentences required will be left blank so that you may determine the criteria which meet the needs of your students.
Directions: Prewriting

Read an adventure story to your class.
Discuss the elements of an adventure story.  (Adventure stories have some sort of adventure in them.  Some examples of adventure might include climbing a big mountain, going to the first day of school, learning to ride a bike, going to the principal's office, etc.  Remember the things that a first and second grader would consider an adventure will be different from those of an adult.)  Ask the students the following question:  What was the adventure in the book we just read?

Drafting

Distribute a copy of ""Adventure Story Starters"" (page 93) to each student.  Have students select one of the story starters and finish the story by telling what happens in the adventure.
Go over the criteria for an adventure story (see objective above).  Clarify with students the expectations for these stories.  Allow time for students to draft their adventure stories.

Editing and Revising

When the stories are drafted, pair students and have them read each others' stories.  Provide copies of ""Adventure Story Peer Assessment"" (page 94) for this purpose.  Partners should check to make sure that all the criteria for the adventure story have been met.
Following the peer editing, students should make any necessary changes and revisions before writing the final copies of their stories.

Publishing and Assessment

Students should type their drafts, using a word-processing program on the computer.  Students could illustrate their final copies with a picture of a character or the scenery.
Use ""Adventure Story Teacher Assessment"" (page 95) to evaluate the final copies of the adventure stories.

"Title: Alphabet Poem
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Editing, Writing Process
Objective: Students use strategies to edit and publish written work.
Directions: Background for the Teacher

Definition:  An alphabet poem uses each letter from either the entire alphabet from A to Z, or a portion thereof, to begin a line of poetry on a chosen topic.

Skills needed:  an understanding of alphabetical order

Preparation:  Reproduce one copy of each worksheet for each student.  Cut out the alphabet squares.  Gather together all of the remaining materials.

Lesson Plan
 Prewriting

Introduce alphabet poems by having students create an alphabetized list about a favorite topic.  You may use the Alphabet Poem Brainstorming worksheet or create a list on the board with the entire class.  Choose a topic such as ""All About Me"" for individual students or ""Our School"" for the whole class.
Distribute one letter square from Alphabet Squares to each student. (Start the alphabet over again if you have more than 26 students, or have students work in pairs.)
Tell the students to think of a word that starts with their letters, one that relates to the chosen topic.  They may write the word on the back of their alphabet squares or dictate them to someone.

 Drafting

On the board or chart paper, write the class alphabet poem by calling each letter of the alphabet in order.  The students, or pairs, can call out their words, or they may come up to write them on the board or chart on the appropriate line.
When all the assigned letters have been called and the words added to the poem, read the poem aloud.  Congratulate the students for having written a poem together.  If the poem was written on chart paper, you may wish to have students create illustrations to be glued around the border of the poem.
Generate a discussion among the students about how they created the poem.  What did they do first?  What did they do next?  How did they think of words to fit?  What did they do last?
Distribute the Alphabet Poem Brainstorming worksheet to the students.  Tell them to select a topic and to brainstorm words that relate to it.
When students are ready, distribute the Alphabet Poem Draft worksheet.  Have the students write their own alphabet poems on the worksheet.  Younger students will need to dictate their poems. 

 Revising/Editing

The students should share their alphabet poems with responders from class (this may be done orally in small groups for pre-readers).  The responders' feedback can be recorded on the Response and Assessment sheet.  
Encourage students to make any changes they wish, after receiving feedback and before writing a final draft.

 Publishing

Post the class-generated alphabet poem, along with the illustrations, in a place where all the students can see it.
Students may wish to use letters cut from magazines and newspapers to illustrate their individual, or partner alphabet poems.  Copies of these poems would make a good classroom book for a writing center.

Content Connections for Alphabet Poems

Language Arts
Make a list of your classmates in alphabetical order.  After each student's name, write a positive word to describe him or her that begins with that letter of the alphabet.  For example:  Steven-Smart, Kyra-Kind.

Math
Assign each letter of the alphabet a number in order.  Create some math equations using letters instead of numbers, for example:  A + A = B (1 + 1 = 2).

Social Studies
Choose a topic from the social studies unit you are studying.  See for how many letters of the alphabet you can find a related word.  Put the words in alphabetical order and you will have a social studies alphabet poem.

Fine Arts
Listen to lots of different music and make a list of all the different ways you might move to it, such as sway, hop, wiggle, etc.  When you have enough words, arrange them in alphabetical order to write a musical movement alphabet poem.

"Title: Characterization
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Art
Objective: The students will draw pictures to generate ideas about a character.  Students will use prewriting skills to plan written work.  Students will dictate or write detailed descriptions of familiar person, places, objects, or experiences.
Directions: 
Read the story Sylvester and the Magic Pebble aloud to the class.  After you have finished, ask students to think about the people in this story.  Using the overhead transparency, write the name of a main character from the story in each circle.  As a class, brainstorm a list of words that could be used to describe the characters in this story.  Write down as many words in the character web as students can generate.

Explain to students that these animals are called the characters of this story.  The characters are an important part of a story.  Characters can be people or animals.  Ask students to think back on different stories they have read before.  Who were some of the characters in those stories?  Encourage students to share examples.  (Some examples might include the Berenstain Bears, Clifford, Sesame Street characters, etc.)

Next, brainstorm a list of other character traits that can be used to describe a character.  Write these on the chalkboard.  Then distribute a copy of ""Create a Character"" (page 26) to each student.  Using the list of words on the chalkboard, students select one or more words from the list and create a character.  Using colored pencils or crayons, have students draw the face of this character.  Some of the descriptions are harder to capture in a drawing than others.

Divide students into groups of four or five.  Have each student take a turn to share his or her character face.  Have students describe to the members in the group all they can about their character.  Have students cut out characters and post them on a bulletin board.  



Portfolio Piece 
Distribute copies of ""Identifying Character Traits"" (page 27) to students.  On this page, have students write down descriptive words about the characters they designed on the character face.  Next, have students think of new characters and then write descriptive words for them.   Store this page in the students' portfolios.  These characters can be used in future stories.

"Title: I Imagine
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Oral Language, Listening, Speaking
Objective: Students use descriptive and imaginative language to encourage a response.
Directions: Discuss with students the importance of using sensory words to describe objects.  Share with them an excerpt from a book or poem they know that uses a sensory description of objects.  There are countless good examples.

Review sensory words used to describe objects.  Talk about words referring to size or weight, shape, texture, sound, and smell.  Select a few objects around the classroom and have students use sensory words to describe them.

Tell students that they will write stories about animals.  These animals can be real or imaginary.  They will be reading these stories to the class.  They will have to write good descriptions so that when they read their stories, the other students in the class will know exactly how to draw the animals that are being described.

"Title: If I Had a Robot. . .
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Art, Mediums
Objective: Students will use a visual aid to add to their creative writing.
Directions: Ask students if they would like to have a robot.  What kinds of things could a robot do for them?  Distribute copies of the If I Had a Robot activity sheet and have the children write about robots.  
After they have written about robots, have them make three-dimensional robots to accompany their writing.

To make a robot, students can choose a large item such as a milk jug or a two-liter plastic bottle to use for the body. They can glue or tape on smaller items to make facial features, arms, legs, and other robot details. Have them add other parts to the robot by cutting and gluing on construction-paper shapes, and then write the robot's name on a name tag and attach it to the robot's body.

"Title: Logical Sequence
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing
Objective: 
The child will identify illogical sequence of sentences in a letter.
The child will retell short stories in sequence.
The child will place sentences in logical order.

Directions: 
Begin the activity by reading the letter below.

     Dear Dad,

    I had a great time on my field trip.  We went to a farm.  For lunch, we went to a nearby park.  You should have seen the huge fields.  I even got to pick a bag of broccoli to take home.  They had a petting zoo at the farm, too.  There were goats and pigs and rabbits.  They were growing broccoli, carrots, lettuce, and tomatoes.  We ate our lunches and then played on the swings and slides.  A goat tried to eat my shirt!  It was right by some mountains.  We got back to school just in time to go home.  It was a super day.

    Your son,

    Mario

Have the children respond to the letter by telling the things they think are out of order.  Read the letter again in logical sequence and compare the two.

Provide each child with a copy of Logical Sequence Lesson 1.  The children are asked to read short stories and then retell the stories by cutting and pasting sentences in proper sequence.
For an additional challenge, provide the children with copies of Logical Sequence Lesson 2.  The children are to read the short letters and underline the sentences that are out of order.
Logical Sequence Lesson 3 can be given to those children who would like to have an even greater challenge.  The children are asked to cut and paste a group of sentences to make a logically sequenced letter.
Finally, instruct each child to write a letter to a friend or family member about a recent school event.  Have the child think of the order of things that occurred and write the letter using logical sequence.

Publishing Project

Have each child edit and rewrite his or her letter.  Encourage each child to deliver his or her letter in person or by mail.
Computer Connection:  Invite interested students to type their letters using a word-processing program.

Evaluation

Lesson Objective:  Evaluate each child's progress by reviewing each child's completed Logical Sequence work sheets.
Writing Applications:  Use your choice of rubrics from pages 134-139 to evaluate each child's written work.  Based on the rubric score, determine the need for reteaching or further practice.  Record skills mastery on the checklist on pages 140 and 141.  If desired, have each child evaluate his or her own work using the self-assessment sheet on page 142.

"Title: My Alien
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Writing, Traits of Writing, Oral Language, Listening, Art, Techniques
Objective: The student will describe the physical features and a special ability or quality of an alien.
Directions: 
Read aloud the text from the ""Hello!  Anybody Out There?""
Hello!  Anybody Out There? What do aliens from outer space look like?  Are they short and green?  tall and purple?  Are there really aliens at all?  Today science has the tools to look for signs of life in outer space. How do scientists search for aliens?  They listen very carefully.  They use huge radio telescopes to listen for signals from space.Earth gives off billions of signals every day.  Maybe creatures on other planets give off signals, too.  The telescopes pick up all kinds of signals.  Then computers sort through them.  They look for ones that did not come from Earth. Why do we search for life?  Because we want to know if we're alone in the universe.  After all, Earth is only one planet, circling one star.  There are 400 billion other stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way.  And there are 100 billion other galaxies!  Do you think we're alone?

Discuss the idea of aliens living on other planets.  Ask the students to imagine how an alien looks.
Display the transparency of ""Identifying an Alien.""  Ask students to describe the size, color, features, and special abilities that his or her alien has.  Model how to write each student's description in the correct column on the activity page.
Example:  I think an alien is about the size of a mouse.  An alien is green, has three eyes, hands, and three feet.  An alien can read people's minds.
    Provide each student with a copy of the activity page.  Have the student fill in the information that can be used to identify an alien.

Display the transparency of ""My Alien.""  Using the descriptions from the ""Identifying an Alien"" activity, model how to add the different features to the alien body.  After drawing the alien, model how to label the different parts.  Give each student a copy of ""My Alien.""  Have the student complete the drawing of the alien and label each part.
Using the overhead projector, model how to use the information from the drawing to write a paragraph describing the alien.  Provide each student with a sheet of paper.  Have the student write about the alien he or she made.  Allow the student to use invented spelling.

Publication

Have each student glue his or her alien and paragraph onto a large sheet of construction paper.  Allow the student to share his or her completed activity with the class.  The finished products can be displayed on a science-related bulletin board.
Using a word-processing program, have the student type the words used as labels on the ""My Alien"" activity page.  Have the student cut out the words and glue them onto the activity page.  (The student can glue the labels on top of the hand-written labels.)

Extension
Using the finished activity, have the students sort the aliens into different groups based on common characteristics.  After the pictures have been grouped, provide each student (or small group of students) with a sheet of paper.  Have the student (or students) list the common characteristic found among all of the aliens in that group.
Example:  All of the aliens in this group have three eyes.  All of these aliens have green bodies.

"Title: My Favorite Thing to Do
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students practice writing clear, well-organized paragraphs.
Directions: 
Tell students that a paragraph is a short piece of writing that has a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Every story, essay, article, or book is like a patchwork quilt made of little paragraphs stitched together.  Every paragraph, like every story or book, has a beginning, a middle, and an end.
Give students some of the basics of paragraphs: The beginning of a paragraphbegins with a topic sentence.  The topic sentence tells the reader what the paragraph will be about.  I have a dog is a topic sentence, but it is not as interesting as I have a talking dog.  The second sentence gives readers more information about what the paragraph will be about and will make them want to read it.
In the middle of the paragraph, each sentence will be about the topic.  If the topic is your talking dog, you won't have a sentence telling about your math test.  Instead you might write My dog knows how to say I love you and ice cream.  You might also want to tell how the dog learned the words. The last sentence of your paragraph is the concluding sentence, or closing sentence.  This sentence will remind your reader of what you are talking about and what the topic means to you.  You might end your paragraph about your talking dog by saying It may not seem like he is talking like humans do, but if you listen closely and have some cheese, you will hear the words, and you will be amazed!
Practice writing paragraphs with students before they begin working on their activity sheets.  You will need to cover the For Younger Students section before duplicating the activity sheet.

"Title: My School Year Memory Book
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Journaling
Objective: Students create memory books of what they have learned and experienced to use throughout the school year.
Directions: Photographs are a great way to get students actively involved in the writing process.
Let parents know that you need film for a special project.Many parents would be more than willing to donate several rolls of film to the class.(Some might even want to pay for the developing costs. It does not hurt to ask!)

Throughout the school year, take pictures of the students as they are involved in different types of activities such as art projects, reading groups, seat work, plays, etc.

Directions for preparing each memory book:
Photocopy the cover (page 54) onto cardstock and write the child's name on the cover. Use cardstock for the back cover also.  Take a picture of the student at the beginning of the year, and paste it to the center of the cover.  Place 12-15 blank pages and copies of pages 55 and 56 in the book.  Staple the book together.  At the beginning of the school year, have each student write his or her name and the letters of the alphabet (see page 55).  Towards the end of the school year, have the student finish filling in the rest of the information on pages 55 and 56.

About every six weeks (or whenever you have several new rolls of film developed) place photographs in baskets and give each group a basket.  Let the students pick out several pictures each that they are in. On 2"" x 7"" (5 cm x 18 cm) strips of paper, have the students write sentences that tell about what was happening when the pictures were taken.  (At the beginning of the school year, some students might need help with writing their sentences.)

Have the students bring the completed strips and their pictures to you.  Check to make sure that the pictures are not already in their memory books.  Go over the sentences with the students.
Then glue the pictures and the sentences into their memory books.

Towards the end of the school year, take several pictures of the whole class.  These pictures can be glued to the inside of the back cover of each student's memory book.

At Open House, place the memory books on the students' desks. The students and their parents will be thrilled to see the school year through the students' eyes.  (Parents who are unable to volunteer in the classroom will be especially appreciative of the pictures.)

Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Editing, Grammar
Objective: Students list as many nouns and verbs as they can in a limited time.
Directions: Before introducing the activity to students, enlarge the noun pattern letters and verb pattern letters from the student sheets and copy them onto tagboard.  Make the letters as large as possible, one per tagboard, if you can.  Laminate the letters, if desired.

Remind children that nouns are words that name people, places, or things.  Pass out the noun sheet to each child.  Have students cut out the letters and arrange them to spell NOUN.  Then ask students to write as many nouns on the letters N, O, U, and N as they can in five minutes.

At the end of five minutes, have the children share the words they wrote.  Record their ideas on the large tagboard letters.  Display the letters for the students' future reference.

Remind children that words are used to show action.  They are words that tell what people, places, or things do.  Pass out the verb sheet to each child.  Have students cut out the letters and arrange them to spell VERB.  Then have them write as many verbs on the letters as they can in five minutes.  Record their ideas on the large tagboard letters.

"Title: Nursery Rhymes
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Editing, Writing Process, Art, Mediums, Techniques
Objective: In this activity, students will use the drawing tool to illustrate nursery rhymes and print pictures with teacher assistance.
Directions: Begin this lesson by sharing several nursery rhymes with the students.  Using a graphics program, students will be illustrating their favorite nursery rhymes.  Before having the students go to the computer, have them plan their drawings on Nursery Rhyme Art (page 23).  The planning sheet has a place for each student to write the nursery rhyme and a place for a sketch of the picture.  Remind students to write the names and authors (if known) of the nursery rhymes they are using.

Demonstrate how to use the drawing tools to illustrate the nursery rhymes the students have heard.  Have students type or stamp the title and/or text of the nursery rhymes to the left of their drawings.
Once the pictures are complete, have the students print their masterpieces and color them (if the students printed in black and white).

As an extension, have students illustrate a number of nursery rhymes this way and make their own nursery rhyme collection books.

"Title: October Writing Journal
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Journaling
Objective: Students use journals to develop their writing skills.
Directions: Journals and SSW
Sustained Silent Writing (SSW) is similar to Sustained Silent Reading (SSR).  It is a specific time each day set aside for the children to practice writing that is ungraded.  The children, however, are expected to do their best work.

Sharing writing encourages children to develop their writing skills.  It is useful to use a variety of methods to allow children to share their work.
Students can share their writing in the following ways:

with the partner next to him or her
with the whole group
with the partner across from him or her
with a partner of choice
with a partner drawn at random
with a small group
in a ""donut"" (One group of children forms a circle with their backs to the middle, and the other children form a circle around them.)


SSW can be done in a journal used expressly for that purpose.  Journals can be made by stapling several pieces of paper between construction paper covers.  The children can be given a new journal each month.  Different colored construction paper each month makes the journals easy to organize.  Monthly journals can be sent home to be shared at the end of each month with a letter to the parents requesting that they be returned the next day.  If desired, you can also ask the parents to write a response to the journals before returning them.  Their responses can be addressed to their children.

The following information is geared toward the use of journals in specific grade levels.  Use these as guidelines for having students complete October Writing Journals.

Kindergarten
Begin by using blank paper on which the children draw a picture.  Sharing their pictures with classmates gives them an audience for whom to draw and helps them to develop their verbal skills.  The next step is for them to use a word or words to label their pictures.  Afterwards, they can begin to use paper with one or more writing lines, drawing a picture and writing about it on the line(s).  Support the children's use of ""kindergarten spelling"" (writing the letters whose sounds they hear when they say the word).  This is a normal and vital step toward the development of conventional spelling.

First Grade
In first grade, children build upon their kindergarten experience.  If they did not experience journal writing in kindergarten, begin with blank paper of pictures and labels.  Decrease the size of the picture portion of the page each month, completely eliminating the picture portion by midyear.  Since the emphasis of SSW after the first month of school should be clearly be writing, encourage children to write before they draw a picture.  Support the children's use of ""first grade spelling"" (writing any letter sounds they hear when they say the word).  Again, this is a normal and necessary step to conventional spelling.

Second Grade
The children will again build on their prior experiences, using a format similar to that used at the end of the first grade.  If the children have not had previous journal writing experiences, begin during the first month with paper allowing a small picture area.  Move to a fully lined page during the following months.  Support the children's use of ""second grade spelling""  (writing conventionally any words they have previously learned and writing down letter sounds they hear when they say the word for any others).  This step brings them very close to complete conventional spelling.

Third Grade
By third grade, the students should have had a fair amount of writing experience.  Build on this prior experience, using a format similar to what was used at the end of second grade.  Provide fully lined paper for their writing, forgoing drawing in lieu of complete writing content.  Require a reasonable amount of conventional spelling, allowing for invented spellings wherever necessary so as not to interrupt the flow of ideas onto paper.  Remember, spelling can always be corrected, and the primary purpose of sustained writing is to encourage fluidity of thought and expression.  Stopping to look up words in the dictionary will sometimes block that flow.

"Title: Oddity Rhyming Strips
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, Oral Language, Listening, Speaking
Objective: Students will practice identification of rhyming words.  By comparing and contrasting pictures, students will practice identifying rhyming sounds.
Directions: Preparation
Copy two blank oddity strip pages for each student plus extra pages for your examples.  Copy each rhyming picture card page for every student, plus extra pages for your examples.  Then, make four to six completed strips to use as examples. To do this, cut your extra copies of page 42 into strips and cut apart the rhyming picture cards.  Next, glue (in any order) two rhyming pictures and one non-rhyming picture on each strip.

Procedure
Seat the children at a table.  Show them one of your prepared oddity rhyming strips.  The lines in italics below should be read to the students.

Today I am going to show you several strips with three pictures.  Two of the pictures will rhyme, and the other will be a trick picture, as it does not rhyme with the other two.  Okay, let's begin.
Name the pictures with me.  ____________,  ____________, and  ____________.  (Student's name), which picture does not rhyme?  Great!  ____________ and ____________ are rhyming words, so the ____________ is the trick picture.

Continue with the other picture strips.  Have the students name the rhyming pairs and identify the trick picture.

Now we are going to make our own rhyming strips.  I will give you each some rhyming pictures and some oddity strips.   We will look at the pictures to see if we can find a rhyming pair to glue on one of your strips.  After we have glued on a rhyming pair, we will then add a trick picture to your strip.  

Pass out the pages and assist the students as they make oddity rhyming strips.  Continue making strips until the allotted time is up.  

Take your rhyming strips home; see if your family can find which two pictures rhyme for each strip.

"Title: Online Words
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Vocabulary
Objective: Students use an online dictionary to define their spelling or vocabulary words while building computer skills.
Directions: Preparation

Have students' spelling/vocabulary lists available
Copy the Online Words page
Write the Web sites' names and URLs on the board


Lesson Steps

Explain to the students that today they will use a dictionary on the Internet to find the definitions of their spelling/vocabulary words.  
Distribute the students' spelling/vocabulary lists and the Online Words page.  Explain to the students that for each word, they will first write what they think the word means, find what the word actually means and write the definition in their own words, and then compose a sentence using the word.
Think of a word and ask students what they think it means.  Write the word and the students' prediction on the Online Words page.  Instruct the students to do the same.
While students are watching, log on to the Internet and launch the Internet browser.  Remind the students how to enter a URL in the Address box and press the Enter key to navigate to the Web site.
Navigate to the student dictionary by following the appropriate hyperlinks.  Point out the box where the students will type each spelling/vocabulary word.  Type the example word and click the Find/Search button.
When the definition appears, read it out loud.  Then, working with the students, come up with another way of defining the word and write that definition below the prediction on the Online Words page.  Discuss how the prediction was similar or different from the actual meaning.  
Together compose a sentence for the word and write that on the Online Words page.
Allow the students to use the Internet, their spelling/vocabulary lists, and the Online Words page to predict a definition, find a definition, and write a sentence for each word.  Note: If the definitions offered by the Internet site are written at a reading level that is too difficult for children to decipher on their own, consider having them use the companion site, pairing students, or doing the entire activity as a class.

Extension Ideas
Anytime the students come across a word they do not know in their reading or daily life, challenge them to predict its definition, and then use the classroom computer to look up the word.  Create a New Words sheet for students to record new words, their predicted definitions, and their actual definitions.  Keep the sheets by the computer.  Also, bookmark the dictionary site on the classroom computer and show students how to access it so you do not have to interrupt what you are doing to help them define a word.  

Consider designating one student the Word Hunter--the person who can use the classroom computer to look up words--when the entire class is reading together, or anytime the entire class comes across an unfamiliar word.

If your students are comfortable doing so, allow them to use a search engine to find their spelling/vocabulary words used in context on other sites.  This might help them compose sentences.

"Title: Pronoun Party
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Grammar
Objective: Students use pronouns to replace nouns in sentences.
Directions: Review nouns with students.  Nouns name a person, place, or thing.  Tell students that pronouns can take the place of a noun in a sentence.  Using a pronoun in a sentence can vary the sentence and even shorten it.  Read to students the two paragraph examples below.

On Saturday, Mark, Jason, and Dan did not have anything to do.  Mark, Jason, and Dan decided to go to the movies.  Mark paid for the tickets for Jason and Dan.  Mark said they were a birthday present for Jason.  Mark, Jason, and Dan enjoyed the movie. 

On Saturday, Mark, Jason, and I did not have anything to do.  We decided to go to the movies.  Mark paid for the tickets for us.  He said they were a birthday present for Jason.  We enjoyed the movie.
Point out to students that in the first paragraph, the names Mark, Jason, and Dan were repeated many times.  The second paragraph occasionally used the pronouns I, we, us, and he in place of the boys names.  Using pronouns in this paragraph varied the sentences and made it shorter and easier to read.

Read the following sentences to the students and see if they can identify the pronouns.

We helped my mom bake cookies.
They scored a lot of points by working together.
The school is being remodeled because it is old.
Mrs. Brown gave Jack a pencil for his birthday.
They enjoy going to the computer lab.
Our dad loves to coach the soccer team.

"Title: Science Fiction Stories
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: The students will be able to write a science fiction story that contains a title, as many sentences as you require, and a conclusion.
Directions: Prewriting

Read a science fiction story to your class.  Ask students what a science fiction story is.  What are the things that make it a science fiction story?  Science fiction is a story based on science where life as we know it has been dramatically changed.  Sometimes it is the characters that have been altered (aliens, dinosaurs, etc.), or the setting (outer space, earth with different surroundings, the moon, etc.). 
Brainstorm with your class a list of things that if scientifically changed would alter the way we live our lives.  (What if our clocks stopped working? or everyone's skin turned green? or the sun stayed up night and day? etc.)  Make a list of these changes on the chalkboard.  Have each student select one change to write a science fiction story about.

Drafting

Distribute copies of Science Fiction Outline to students.  Have students answer the questions to prepare for writing their science fiction stories.
When students have finished the work sheet, have them write the drafts of their science fiction stories.  Go over the criteria for the science fiction story (see objective above).  Clarify with students the expectations for these stories.

Editing and Revising

When the stories are drafted, pair students up with a partner, and have students read each others' stories.  Provide Science Fiction Peer Assessment for this purpose.  Partners should check to make sure that all the criteria for the science fiction story have been met.
Following the peer editing, students should make any necessary changes and revisions before writing the final copies of the stories.

Publishing and Assessment

Students should type their drafts, using a word-processing program on the computer.  Students could illustrate their final copies with a picture of a character or the scenery.
Use Science Fiction Teacher Assessment to evaluate the final copies of the science fiction stories.

"Title: Story Dolls
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Journaling, Oral Language, Speaking, Art, Mediums
Objective: Students express themselves through art and writing.
Directions: This activity allows the students to express themselves through art and writing simultaneously.  The students can use the patterns on the following pages to create paper doll versions of themselves.  They should add yarn for hair, buttons for eyes, and sequins, glitter, rickrack, ribbon, etc., for all of the other details.

On the bodies of the dolls, ask the students to each attach a small book of autobiographical information.  Make photocopies of the circular pattern for the students' books.  You might want to set up some  page guidelines similar to these.

Cover: title and author
Page 1: full name and age
Page 2: parents'/guardians' names
Page 3: siblings' names and ages
Page 4: pets' names
Page 5: what I want to be when I grow up

Staple the pages together onto the body of the paper doll to make a book.  Patterns are available on pages 51 and 52.

Ask the students to share their projects with their classmates.  (Note:  This makes a great ""get to know you"" activity at the beginning of the school year.)  Display the finished autobiographical dolls and books around the classroom.

"Title: Synonyms: Frogs
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Vocabulary
Objective: Students will brainstorm frog related words, identify synonyms and practice using synonyms in sentences.
Directions: Pre-Internet Activity:
Have the students brainstorm everything they know about frogs.  Record their responses in a pond drawn on chart paper.  Review the list at the end of the brainstorming session.  If the class thinks the statement is true, they jump like a frog once.  If they disagree with the statement or think it is false, they make a croaking sound.  Explain that they will have a chance to learn more about frogs on the Internet as well as practice identifying synonyms.

Teaching the Lesson:
Play this synonym review game.  Using the list of synonyms below (or any others you have), call out a pair of words.  Since the words are synonyms, the students hop like frogs to someone else's seat.  Be sure to include some word pairs that are not synonyms.  When non-synonym pairs of words are called, the students simply ""gribbet"" like a frog and wait for a synonym pair to be called so they may hop along to the next desk. Go online to learn more about frogs at one of the suggested Web sites listed below.  A cute idea is to use a fly swatter since frogs are known to like flies.  To do this, hand a fly swatter to one student as his/her clue to come to the computer and explore the Web sites.  After connecting to a few links, he/she hands the swatter to another student who may do the same, and so on. Distribute a copy of page 40 to each student to complete independently.  You might have the students work on this while some are at the computers. You can label the frog and lily pad patterns (in the PDF file) with the synonym pairs for students to practice during center time.

Extended Activity:
Post the list of synonyms for the students to see.  Working with partners, have them devise a short script about frogs, using one of the synonym pairs.  First, they should consider the characters of their skits.  They can pretend to be frogs, two friends talking about frogs, scientists studying frogs, high school students dissecting frogs, etc.  Then they should consider their settings: the pond, aquarium, lab, school, etc.  Finally, they write their two-synonym skits keeping their characters and settings in mind.  After the partners perform for the class, the class members should identify who they were, where the skit took place, and the two synonyms they included.

List of sample synonyms:
ill and sick
fast and quick
exit and leave
easy and simple
hard and difficult
funny and amusing
harm and damage
close and shut
buy and purchase
walk and step
hop and jump
big and large
fat and chubby
sly and clever
old and aged
search and seek
smell and odor
stare and gaze
happy and glad
smart and wise

"Title: Clifford: The Bones of the Story
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension
Objective: Students describe the five elements of a story--setting, characters, problem, events, and resolution.
Directions: Introduce your students to Clifford by reading to them or having them read Clifford the Small Red Puppy, Clifford's Puppy Days, or Clifford the Big Red Dog.
Set the stage for reading the books by discussing the following questions:

How many of you have a dog?  
Did you get him or her as a puppy?  
What are some of the memorable moments you have had with your dog?  
How has your dog been a good friend to you?  
How would it be different if you had a small dog (or a large dog)?


If you have all three books, display the covers.  Ask the following questions about the covers:

How are they alike?  
How are they different?  
How has Clifford changed on the three covers?  
How do you think this happened?  
What would you do if your dog grew to be this big?


Introduce the characters in the books:  Emily Elizabeth and her parents, Clifford and his family, Emily Elizabeth's Aunt Martha, and the Baker. Introduce the five elements of a story:  setting, characters, problem, events, and resolution.  Help them to identify these elements in the Clifford story.  Then have them fill out the work sheets with the information they have learned.

"Title: The Daily News
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Journaling
Objective: Students use headlines to recall and write about important events in the school day.
Directions: The Daily News can be done with the whole class at circle time, at the beginning or end of the school day, or individually in daily news journals.  The purpose of this activity is for the students to recall and write about something that they did during the school day (or the prior school day if you are doing this activity in the morning).  The students might write about a new math concept, a new set of spelling words, a field trip, a school assembly, etc.  This will involve the students in writing in a non-threatening manner.  This activity might also help open up parent-child communication.  When the students go home and their parents ask, ""What did you learn today?"", the students will have an answer instead of the usual, ""Nothing!""

If you should choose to do this activity as a whole class, copy the record on page 29 on chart paper or make an overhead transparency copy.  The chart paper can be laminated, and the students can use erasable pens to write on the laminated chart paper.  At the end of the week, just spray the chart with window cleaner and wipe off the sentences.  If you are using an overhead projector, photocopy the transparency at the end of the week.  Send home a copy with each student.  This will help keep the parents informed about what is happening in the classroom.

About halfway through the year, the students can begin making their own copies of The Daily News.  As a whole class, talk about the different things that happened during the day.  Each student can then write his or her own sentence about the day.  At the end of the week, the students can take their daily records home and share them with their families.

"Title: Anthropomorphic Writing: The Laughing Leaf
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Journaling, Art, Mediums
Objective: Students will learn about and practice real-object writing.
Directions: Young children are very kinesthetic learners who love to see, hear, smell, taste, and touch real objects.  The objects or props you use when studying dinosaurs, such as model dinosaurs or fossil specimens, are called ""realia.""

This realia is very important when children are involved in object writing.  There are two different object-writing types.  The first one deals with children writing about their own personal experiences with the subject.  For example, children may be asked to wear their favorite T-shirts and then write about the shirts; where they got them, what makes them so special, etc.  The second type of object writing deals with ""anthropomorphism"" or ascribing human form or attributes to a nonhuman thing or being.  For example, many pet owners do this with their pets, treating them more like small human babies, talking to them, cuddling them, etc.

For young writers, beginning object-writing lessons consist of fill-in stories.  This gives them guidelines and experience in reading complete sentences in a beginning-to-ending format, which tells detailed information about the writing subject. 

This anthropomorphic object writing activity has specific directions for students to follow.  This kind of writing can be challenging for children because it requires writing complete sentences.  You may want to enlist the help of adult volunteers or cross-age peers, to help the children fill in their story ideas. 

If possible, bring in a leaf for each child to place on his or her desk while completing the activity.

"Title: Using the Table of Contents
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension
Objective: The student will use a table of contents to find information in a book.
Directions: Procedure

Distribute copies of the page, Table of Contents.  Explain that books have a page that helps us find what we are looking for in a book.  Write Table of Contents across the chalkboard.  Have a book available for each student to refer to at this time.
Have students look inside their books to find the table of contents.  Have them keep their fingers in their books to mark the place until all students find the table of contents.  Explain that a table of contents lists all the subjects in the book and the pages on which they can be found.  Most books that share information have a table of contents.
Ask students to locate topics in their books.  What are some of these topics?  On what pages can these topics be found?  Have students practice choosing a topic, seeing the page on which it is found, and locating the page in the book.  It can be very difficult for some students to find the pages.  Be available for assistance and be sure that the books your students are using are not too long or too difficult.  
Go over the four questions found on the Table of Contents page.  Check to be sure that students understand the questions and allow students time to complete the work sheet.  Circulate around the room to offer assistance, as needed.
Schedule a time, if necessary, for your students to use the library for researching purposes.  Remind students of proper library behavior and procedures before you go.
Assist students in locating books, encyclopedias, and other materials to research their animals.  Have students look for books that have information about their animals.  Next, have students look in the table of contents of each book to determine whether there is information in the book on their research animals.  Allow students time to practice using the table of contents.  Students may check out books they find that have information about their research animal.  Schedule more time in the library for students to research, as needed.

Assessment

Check to see that students have completed the Table of Contents page correctly.
Check off the appropriate research strategy skill (4B) on the Teacher Checklist on page 24 of the Assessment Section.  Assess student work using the Research Assessment Rubric on page 52.

Resources:

"Title: What Did You Say?
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Punctuation
Objective: Students will learn to use quotation marks around a direct quote and use a comma to set off a quotation.
Directions: Tell students that quotation marks are used to show the words a person is saying. Give them this example: 
Mary said, ""I love the color blue.""

The words inside the quotation marks show the exact words Mary said.  Notice that a comma is used to separate what Mary said from the rest of the sentence.

Write the following sentences on the board and have students work as a class to place a comma and quotation marks in each sentence.

The doctor said  You are in good health.
Marty said  My lizard escaped from the cage.
He said You look nice today.
Mrs. Thomas said Line up at the door.
Dad said Come in for dinner.

Tell students that the word said is not the only word used to show that a person is speaking.  Other words that can show a person is speaking are asked, screamed, questioned, wondered, yelled, and whispered.

Write the following sentences on the board and have students place a comma and quotation marks in each sentence.

Michael asked Can I have a glass of milk?
Watch out! screamed Judy.
Jason wondered  Should I go with them?
My sister whispered Is the movie almost over?
Mom yelled Go, Wildcats, go!

"Title: Yakety-Yak!
Grade Level: 1st - 3rd Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Punctuation, Traits of Writing
Objective: Students learn about dialogue and ways to use dialogue in writing stories.
Directions: Discuss with students the process of writing stories.  Focus on the characters within a story.  As a class, discuss the following dialogue example.

When your characters start talking to each other, that is called dialogue.  Dialogue helps you to show what a character is like.

If someone falls down and your character says, ""Hah! That was pretty funny!"" that tells the reader what your character is like.  If instead your character says, ""Are you okay?"" that says something different about your character.

Imagine two characters.  One is nasty and the other is nice.  Think about what each character might say in each of the situations.




 
 Nasty   
 Nice   


 To a new boy at school   
 ""You can't play.""   
 ""Come play with us.""   


 To someone who has just offered an invitation to a party   
 
 


 To the substitute teacher   
 
 


 To a parent who has said it's time for bed   
 
 


 To the teacher who says it's time to put away the equipment   
 
 




Challenge: Listen to dialogue wherever you go.  Listen to people of all ages in all kinds of places.  Write down interesting sayings, expressions, or accents you hear.  Using the activity above write the responses you might imagine from a timid character, a funny character, a smart character, or an athletic character.

For Younger Students: Take dictation as they think of how one type of person might respond as opposed to another:  For instance, to the new boy in school, the nasty character might say, ""Get lost,"" or ""Go away!""  The nice character might say, ""Hello,"" or ""Do you want to play with us?""  Be sure they realize that this activity is not about any real person they know or themselves; it is about fictional characters that they are imagining.

"Title: Flags
Grade Level: 1st - 4th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Vocabulary, Writing, Writing Process, Journaling, Oral Language, Listening, Speaking, Art, Mediums
Objective: The students will write a description of a flag.
Directions: 
Decide whether the whole class will participate in writing a description, or if the students will do so individually.

Have the students study the flag they will be describing in their writing.  This will be done by either having the entire class view the one flag they will be describing, or by handing out pictures of various flags to each individual student.  What colors are in the flag?  What symbols are used?  Where are the colors and symbols placed in the flag?  How would the students write a description of the flag for someone who cannot see it?  If this project is being done as a whole class, record their descriptive sentences on chart paper.

If older students are doing this project individually, have them keep their flag picture a secret.  Once their descriptions are written, display the flag pictures for all the students to view.  Then each student may read their description while the rest of the class tries to match the description with the picture.


Extension Ideas
As an alternative to the above, combine a Language Arts Lesson with an Art Lesson.  Have the students write a description of the flag they have created during the art lesson.  They may want to include a description of the process of creating their flag and what any of the symbols mean.
Have a lesson on symbols and what they mean.  Discuss the different symbols used in the American Flag.  Relate this to symbols used in written language.  What do the different punctuation marks mean-- . , ? ! ?

Read the Pledge of Allegiance.  A great book to use for this activity is The Pledge of Allegiance by Francis Bellamy (Editor), Scholastic.  Make a list of the unknown words and look up their definitions.  If desired use ""The Pledge of Allegiance"" activity sheet (most appropriate for older students).
Resources: 
, The United States Flag or any other flag.  (Pictures of flags may be used as well.)  Refer to the following Web sites (see Internet Links below):  Flags or Flags Of The World.  If the class will be doing this project individually, have enough pictures of flags so there is one per student.

"Title: Team Stories
Grade Level: 1st - 4th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing, Oral Language, Speaking
Objective: Students work together to write stories.  Each student uses creative thinking skills to compose the beginning, middle, or end of a story.
Directions: Ask students if they have ever made up stories with their friends with each of you taking a turn to add to the story.  Tell them that it can be fun to add to a story that is written by a team of writers.
Here is how to do it with your whole class:


Distribute the Team Stories page of story starters to each student.  Each student can take out a piece of paper.  Students can use one of the story starters to begin their stories.  Ask them if they can think of ways to make it interesting.  Have students copy the story starter of their choice and then write another paragraph or two to continue the story.  They should add a title at the top of their stories.
When they have finished, have them look carefully to make sure other people will be able to read what you wrote.
When time is up, have them stop and turn in their stories.
After you have collected the stories, make copies of what students have written so far.
Next, on a different day if time is limited, pass out the stories.  Each student should have one that someone else wrote.
Give them time to write the middle part of someone else's story.  They should be sure to use the same characters that are in the beginning of the story and decide how it will continue.
7.Have them make sure your middle can be read by others and turn it in.  Make copies of the new, longer stories.
Finally, it will be time to write the endings to the stories.  Pass out the stories again.  Be sure that they get stories that were written by other students.
Now students have the tough job of writing an ending to stories that they did not start.  They should be sure to use the same characters and write an ending that makes sense.
Collect all of the stories.  The entire class can have a story festival, sharing the team stories.


The Story Festival
State the title of the first story to be read.  The author of that story's beginning will come up to read the whole story.  When students hear the titles they wrote, they will go to the front of the class to read the team's story.  They may be surprised at what happened to their stories.  When students finish reading the whole story, they may wish to tell the class how they thought the story would go and what surprised them about the middle and ending.

When everyone is finished, discuss the stories.  Did anyone have trouble continuing a story?  Why?  Did any story come out just as expected?  What were you thinking or feeling as you were writing your story parts?  Which was the most fun: the beginning, the middle, or the ending?  Which was the easiest to write? 

Challenge
Create report folders with about 10 pages each.  Each student can write a story start on the first page and add his or her name to the bottom of the page.  Put the folder in a box or on a shelf with story folders for the entire class.  When students  have some free time, they  can take out another folder, add a page to whatever story had been started, and add their name to the bottom of that page.  Tell them not to write their pages one after another; but to be sure to allow someone else a turn in between.  They can write in as many books as they like.  If they wish to, they can add illustrations to the page.  Tell them not to forget to read the stories too.

For Younger Students
Have the class, or a team of students, sit in a circle.  Allot a time period, and pick a number so that students can try to guess the number.  The student who comes closest gets to begin.  The first student starts the story by introducing the characters and the setting, begins to tell some of the action, and then stops.  The student to his or her left takes up where the first student left off and stops to allow the next student to continue, and so on.  Continue as many times around the circle as time allows.  (If you use a timer, let students see how much time is left, and it may motivate them to start tying together loose ends to create a conclusion.)

"Title: The Legend of the Mexican Flag
Grade Level: 2nd - 4th Grades
Description: Social Studies, World History
Objective: Students learn about Cinco de Mayo and color the Mexican flag in honor of this holiday.
Directions: Cinco de Mayo (the fifth of May) is a Mexican national holiday also celebrated by Hispanics in the United States.  Hispanic students and others enjoy this as a fiesta that comes near the end of the school year and celebrates their ethnic identity as Mexican-Americans and Spanish speakers.
How did it all start?  During the American Civil War (1861-1865), while the United States was fighting internally over the slavery issue and economics, Europeans decided to invade Mexico to collect some bad debts.  France also wanted an empire, so in 1862, they sent an army to take over Mexico.
Benito Juarez, the first president of Mexico (who was also a Zapotec Indian) resisted the French invasion, rallying the Mexican people to resist.  The Battle of Pueblo took place on May 5, 1862.  The Mexican Army, under General Ignacio Zaragoza, defeated the well-trained French Army with poor Indian peasants.  The victory proved that the French were not invincible.  The French ""empire"" in Mexico collapsed five years later when Emperor Maximilian was executed.
Along with the music and dances of Mexico that play a big part in any Cinco de Mayo celebration, the flag of Mexico is displayed.
The Legend of the Mexican Flag
The Mexican flag dates back to 1821.  It is divided into three vertical sections.  The left section is solid green for independence.  The center section is white for religious purity.  The right section is red for national unity.
In the middle of the center section is the Mexican coat of arms.  This symbol depicts an eagle perched on a cactus and devouring a snake.  This symbol is borrowed from an Aztec legend.  The Aztecs were latecomers to the central plateau of Mexico.  When they arrived from the north around 1325, most of the land was already divided among the tribes who had already been living there.  The Aztecs believed that their deity Huitzilopochtli had given them a vision: that when they saw an eagle devouring a snake while perched on a cactus, they would be home.  They spotted this on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco.  It is here that they established their home of Tenochtitlan.  
When the conquistadors arrived in 1519, Tenochtitlan was larger than the great cities of Europe.  Today, as then, it is the largest city in the world.  

Directions for Flag

Color the flag on page 109 according  to the legend.

"Title: The Magic of Static
Grade Level: 2nd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students will have fun investigating the magic of static electricity.
Directions: Lesson Preparation

Set up stations for students to rotate through using the information on the data sheets.  If possible, set up duplicates of each station to have fewer students at each of them.
Test each of the stations and adjust the setup as needed to match the students' ability levels.
Establish a rotation system which will allow at least 15 minutes at each station.
Arrange for adult or older student volunteers to be assigned to each station to assist the students as needed, if they are not able to do the work alone.


Activity

Introduce the students to each of the stations.  Explain the instructions which they are to follow as they work at each of them.  Demonstrate how they are to use the materials at the various stations.
Divide the students into groups of three or four students and assign each group to begin at a different station.  Allow sufficient time for each group to explore the materials at their station before moving them on to the next.  This lesson should be spread over more than one day to enable the students to benefit from experimenting with the materials and sharing their ideas.

Closure

When all students have visited each of the stations, have each group demonstrate one of the exciting new discoveries they made as they investigated static electricity.
Invite another group of students to visit the classroom and have your students show them the discoveries they made about static electricity.
Use the transparency (page 20) to review the lesson.


Particles and Electric Fields
Normally, an atom has an equal number of electrons and protons, and so it is electrically neutral.  If an atom gains some electrons, it becomes negatively charged.  If an atom loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged.  Atoms that have an electric charge--either positive or negative--are called ions.
Every particle is surrounded by an electric field.  Charged particles exert a force on one another, even when not touching, because each electric field extends into the space around each particle.
Uncharged Particles
If two balloons are uncharged, they do not exert any force between them.
Particles with Unlike Charges
If one balloon is charged positively and the other negatively, their electric fields interact and pull them together.
Particles with Like Charges
If two balloons are each negatively (or each positively) charged, their electric fields interact and cause them to move apart.

"Title: What Shape is the Moon Tonight?
Grade Level: 2nd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will gather data about the phases of the moon._
Directions: Make a transparency of the Classroom Moon Record and project it onto the black paper.  The diameter should stretch at least two feet (60 cm).  Use white crayon to trace the arc and pencil to make the small marks.  These represent the positions of the moon during half the month.

Pre-activity (Begin this lesson two days after the new moon.  Check the weather section of the newspaper or a calendar for this date.)

Distribute the parent letter and Student Moon Record.  Discuss these with the students so they understand how to record the phases of the moon every evening at the same time.
Show them the Classroom Moon Record and say that each day you will place a moon shape there showing what they report in the evening sky.  Point out where the sun is shown on the record.
As students report the moon shape each day, cut an adhesive dot into that shape and place it on the chart.  The first one will be on the first or second mark, depending upon how many days past the new phase this record is begun.
After three days of recording data, have students predict how the next day's phase will look.  Draw all predictions on the board and check them the next day.  If a night is cloudy, have students predict what the shape of the moon was, based on the phases before and after.

Closure

Review the positions and phases of the moon relative to the sun's position.  Repeat the activity with the balls and light so students can see how this represents what they are recording.
About two days after the moon is full, look for it in the morning sky in the west.  Its phase will change to gibbous, quarter, and then a crescent as it gets closer to the sun each day.  Be sure they see that it is now the left side of the moon which is illuminated by the sun.


Extender
Make a daytime record of moon phases after the full moon.  Project the moon record on blue paper and make the same markings.  Since this is a day view, the sun should appear in the east (sunrise).  Even though students will view the moon after the sun has risen, the sun can be in the east.  The full moon would be in the west as the sun is rising.  As the moon changes to gibbous, circles can be cut according to views seen and glued along the arc, continuing west to east, as the moon moves around Earth.  The last quarter phase would be 90° between the east and west; the final crescent would be very close to the sun as it rises in the east.

"Title: Washington, D.C.
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students apply mapping skills to place a monument located in Washington, D.C., on a classroom map of the Mall area.  They research the monument and provide a drawing and information to accompany the map.
Directions: Monuments

The Vietnam Veterans Memorial
Arlington National Cemetery
The Jefferson Memorial
The Lincoln Memorial
The Marine Corps War Memorial
The Roosevelt Memorial
The Washington Monument


Enlarge the map of the Mall on page 19 (label only the Capitol Building and Smithsonian Castle) onto a sheet of poster board.  Display it along with the names of seven monuments (with numbers) located in Washington, D.C.: 1. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 2. Arlington National Cemetery, 3. The Jefferson Memorial, 4. The Lincoln Memorial, 5. The Marine Corps War Memorial, 6. The Roosevelt Memorial, and 7. The Washington Monument.  Have them speculate about the purpose of each monument.  Explain to the students that they will have an opportunity to research each monument and discover where it is located on the map of the D.C. area.
Teaching the Lesson:

Divide the class into seven groups, one to research each monument.  Assign the groups a monument to research by randomly distributing the cards to the groups.
Distribute a copy of page 18 to each group.  Allow the groups to access the Internet, gather their information, and mark the location of their monument by writing the number on the Mall map.  (The Marine Corps War Memorial is located near Arlington National Cemetery, and the Roosevelt Memorial is in West Potomac Park on the Tidal Basin.)
Students each transfer their sketches from the research guide onto a three-by-five-inch note card and cut it out around its outline.  They secure it next to the location they marked on the map by folding the bottom edge of the picture back and gluing the tab to the poster board.  Then they summarize the information they learned on an additional note card, including the name of the monument and the number.  (Each monument on the map has a number next to it and a corresponding number on the card that gives details about it.)
Secure all the cards to one sheet of construction paper.
Display the completed three-dimensional Washington, D.C., map and cards in the library or on a table in the front office.

Activities:
Students may elect to create a simple three-dimensional model of their monument instead of simply using a paper drawing.  Supply the students with the materials they need to complete this task.  Follow the steps above to complete the map.
Have the students reflect on their knowledge of American history to design and create a model of an original monument.  They make a sketch or three-dimensional image of the monument and write a summary of its purpose, following the research guide on page 18.  Students share their original monument with the class.

"Title: Who's Who at Our School?
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Oral Language, Listening, Speaking, Social Studies
Objective: Students recognize and use language appropriately for varied contexts and purposes.  Students integrate listening, speaking, viewing, reading, and writing for multiple purposes.  Students develop and use a variety of strategies to plan, draft, revise, and edit different forms of text for specific purposes.
Directions: Description
This project is designed to let children practice interview and writing skills, plus allow new teachers, new families, substitutes, and others an interesting way to get to know the staff at our elementary school.  The students will be writing their own interview questions, developing a paragraph about their staff member, and then use the digital camera to take their picture.  They will enter all of this information onto a HyperStudio card and the teacher will then take all of the cards and make a stack to be shared with everyone.  It can also be turned into a slideshow for viewing on the school's entryway TV during conferences or any other special occasion.
Procedure
When new families, new teachers, and substitutes come into school buildings for the first time, they don't know anyone.  This lesson would be an interactive project that allows the students to inform others about who works at our school and what they do.  It helps them produce quality work because they are showing their work to someone other than themselves or their teacher, and they are responsible for organizing all of their material in order to have their HyperStudio card make sense.  It will also make them follow and stick to a time line.  They will need to be organized enough to stay on top of their job.
This project also focuses on technology, in that the children will display their knowledge through such a powerful medium.  They are always so excited about using the computers and without knowing it, will be learning the software while they enter all the information that they have gathered.  In order to get to this point, they will need to use some higher order thinking skills by setting up the interview, writing their own questions, sending out a reminder, conducting the interview, and from there, manipulating all the information that they have gathered from their interview to produce a quality writing piece about their staff member.  Discuss with students how this paragraph will need to be interesting and informative.  Work on how to make that happen during the whole writing process.  A project like this will also allow the children to spend time in engaging conversations with others.  After they interview their staff member, they will be evaluated by the staff member on their interview skills.  They will also be talking with their peers about their work and filling out a rubric to make sure they are on track.  This will allow the children to evaluate themselves and others.  It also gives them some insight on how effective communication can be when it is done correctly.
Preparation
If you do this project at the beginning of the year, the children will need some extra time with directions, etc.  To introduce the project and discuss what good interviewing looks like and sounds like, watch videos of interviews and have class discussions about appropriate interview questions.  Notify the staff about this project so that they will know what to expect.  Have students begin writing their questions and sharing them with their ""peer editors.""  Help students set up a time to interview their staff member and then conduct the interview.  This should take approximately a week from start to finish.  Give students the opportunity to finish their rough drafts and be ready to have them edited by their partner.   Editing should take one day and then they should be ready for the computers.  Prepare the interviewing and writing rubrics.  When the students have all saved their cards, you will need to put the final project together.  Connect the buttons to make the HyperStudio stack flow.
Step-by-Step Teacher and Student Instructions
The students will be given a staff member to interview and a ""peer editor"" partner.  These will be set up by the teacher.
The students will be given the rubrics and will need to set up their interview time with their staff member.  This will all be discussed as a class before they make the arrangements.  After they set up their appointment, they will need to design an invitation reminder for their staff member.
While they are waiting for their interview date to come, they will be working on their interview questions and discussing with their ""peer editor"" which are good questions and which need to be thrown out.
During the interview, the children will need to get all of their questions answered and take a digital picture of their staff person.  They will also have their staff person fill out their rubric and have it returned to their teacher.
After the interview the children will need to send a thank you to their staff member and then take all of their information and turn it into an informative, interesting paragraph.  This rough draft will need to follow the rubric and will be edited by their partner.  The teacher will look at it before the child goes to the computer.
When the paragraph has been edited by their peer editor and their teacher, the child will be required to enter all of their information on to a HyperStudio“ card.  They will have to add a text box, add a button, and insert a picture on their card.  
All of the children will save their cards in one folder, so that it is easy for the teacher to connect the buttons and finish the project.  It can also be run as a slideshow if the teacher would like.
The children will be able to view the project and share it with the staff member they interviewed.  They will also be in charge of sharing it with new families, new teachers, and substitutes when they are in the building.
Assessment
The students will be required to have the staff member they interview fill out the rubric about the interview and they will also evaluate themselves.  They will also have a rubric that will focus on their writing.  This will be filled out by the student, their peer editor, and the teacher.  This evaluation will be done after all of the students finish their project.
Extensions
This project could be done as a movie and edited that way or it could be done with a digital video camera and made into an iMovie.  You could also interview people out in the community or any others that the children would find interesting.

"Title: Simulation: Direction March
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students will move toward a designated cardinal or intermediate direction as instructed by a game card.
Directions: Preparation
Copy, cut, and shuffle direction cards.  Make a transparency of the game board or draw it on the chalkboard.  Obtain game markers.
Procedure

Students may play the game as individuals or as teams, depending upon teacher preference.
Place the game board transparency on the overhead so that it is readily visible to all students.
For each team or individual playing, place a game marker on one of the four lines touching the START point.
The teacher (or other designated direction caller) turns over one direction card for each player or team and announces the move, for example, 3 Spaces West.
Using the overhead transparency, the individual or designated team member must then move his or her marker the appropriate direction and distance along the interconnecting lines and points--vertically (N-S), horizontally (E-W), or diagonally (NE-SW, NW-SE).
Once the player releases the marker, his or her turn is over and the caller proceeds to the next team.
Players cannot exit the board on moves that would pass through the arrow points.
The game may be played so that either the first team (player) or the last team (player) to exit the board is the winner.  With respect to incorrect responses, if the goal is to exit first, incorrect moves dictate that the marker be returned to START.  However, if the object is to be the last to leave the board, incorrect answers will cause that marker to be placed on a point at the edge of the board (not on an arrow point).

Background 
Direction March is primarily designed for students with little experience in map reading skills and are having difficulty mastering the intermediate directions.  Depending upon the experience of the students involved, the instructor may want to include a simple compass rose with an indicator for North.  Space for a compass rose is provided at the top of the game board.
Follow-Up 
You may also want to connect a review session to this game by linking moves on the game board with correct responses to questions from the current social studies text lesson.

"Title: Making a Tepee and Buckskin Paper
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies, United States History, Art, Mediums
Objective: Students will practice their arts and crafts skills while learning about Cheyenne Tepees and buckskin paper.
Directions: 

Display pictures of tepees.  Read and discuss page 30.  
If possible, measure and mark the diameter of a tepee with chalk on the blacktop or use a length of string to demonstrate the size on the classroom floor.
If desired, give paper a leather texture by following the steps below.
When the paper has dried, use the compass to draw a large circle.  Use a diameter that is slightly shorter than the sticks.  Cut out the circle, then cut it in half to form a tepee cover. 
Use tempera paint to add Native American designs to the tepees.
Tie three sticks together and spread them into a tripod.
Glue the cover over the frame.

Buckskin Paper
Native Americans made many of their necessities from the hides of the buffalo or other animals.  In the late nineteenth century, expansion and white trappers nearly made the species almost extinct.  Follow the directions below to make paper that looks like leather or buckskin.  Use the paper for making Indian crafts.
Materials

sponge
paper plate
old toothbrush 
crayons
tempera or acrylic paint
paper (grocery bags, butcher paper, brown wrapping paper, or school craft paper)


Directions
Method 1: Select crayons in brown, rust, and orange.  Peel the paper wrapper from the crayon and use the side to cover the paper with scribbles.  Make many layers of different colors.  Rub the colors with a paper towel or rag to blend them together.
Method 2: Use a paper plate as a palette.  Place a dab of paint of each color on the plate.  Use colors like brown, ocher, and burnt sienna.

"Title: Memorial Day--The Gettysburg Address
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students will learn about Memorial Day and memorize the Gettysburg Address, a traditional highlight of Memorial Day programs.
Directions: Memorial Day is the day on which Americans honor those who have died for their country. It is celebrated on May 30th, or on the last Monday in May in order to make a three-day weekend. (On the calendar you may see ""Traditional Memorial Day"" on May 30th and ""Memorial Day Observed"" on the last Monday.) It is a legal holiday in most states. And, even though it falls in May, it is usually considered to be the mark of the beginning of summer.
Memorial Day was originally called Decoration Day because it was the day women in the South chose to decorate the graves of men who had died in the Civil War. These women honored the dead of both armies, Union and Confederate. It is thought that Cassandra Oliver Moncure, a Virginia woman of French ancestry, started the movement.
In the northern states, the Grand Army of the Republic, which was an organization of veterans of the Union Army during the Civil War, was in charge of Memorial Day celebrations. The American Legion took over this responsibility after World War I. Today they sell small artificial red poppies around Memorial Day to raise money to help disabled veterans.
Military parades are held on Memorial Day and special programs take place at Gettysburg and at Arlington National Cemetery. A highlight of these programs is often the reading of President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.

Making It Work
Ask your students if any have gone to a cemetery to decorate a grave. Was it a military cemetery? Was it the grave of someone who died in a war? Allow students to share experiences.
Ask students who come from different homelands to tell about ceremonies that honor the people who died in wars in the countries where they used to live. They may have first-hand experiences or they may wish to interview an older relative to get this information. Students may be interested in building an oral history of their family by tape-recording these interviews. (Make sure they get permission before recording an interview, even with a family member.)
If there are no representatives of other backgrounds in your classroom, have students do some research in the library to find out how other countries honor those who died in wars. Students can write reports or give oral reports to the class.
Read Lincoln's Gettysburg Address to your students. Encourage them to memorize it. (See the activity sheet.)

Extension Idea
Find out about the American Legion and its use of red poppies. Often the American Legion holds competitions concerning patriotism, and poppies are a common theme. Find out if there is one such competition in your area.

"Title: Olympians Don't Quit
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Social Studies
Objective: Students learn about the challenges faced and overcome by Olympic athletes.
Directions: Ask students about goals that they have set for themselves.  Did they ever want to give up because something happened that made their goals harder to achieve?  Tell them that this has happened to Olympians, too.  Discuss with them the following life stories.
Dutch athlete Fanny Blankers-Koen, age 22, was looking forward to the 1940 Olympic Games, sure she would win the gold as a sprinter.  But World War II came along, and both the 1940 and the 1944 Olympic Games were canceled.  She continued training, gave birth to a son and a daughter, and looked forward to the 1948 games.  By that time Fanny was 30, much older than the other sprinters.  She won  the 100-meter dash and the 80-meter hurdles, only to be mobbed by reporters who would not let her rest for her remaining events.  Yet she went on to win the 200-meter race and was a member of the winning 4 x 100-meter relay.  Fanny was the first woman ever to have won four track and field gold medals in the same Olympiad.
In 1938, Hungarian army sergeant Karoly Takacs was a member of his national pistol shooting team and expected to win in the 1940 Olympic Games, but a tragic accident happened.  While he was on maneuvers, a hand grenade exploded, leaving Karoly without his right hand, his shooting hand.  His hopes for gold dashed, Takacs was allowed to remain in the army, despite his disability.  He was severely depressed, but he began training again with a pistol, this time using his left hand.  At the 1948 Olympic Games, Captain Takacs stood on the winner's platform wearing his gold medal for pistol shooting.  He won it with his left hand, the hand he had never used for shooting prior to the accident ten years earlier.
Ray Ewry of Lafayette, Indiana, was paralyzed as a child and spent much of his childhood in a wheelchair.  Doctors believed that he would never walk again.  He devoted hours to exercise and not only walked, but developed great strength in his legs.  He won the three jumping events at Paris in 1900 at the age of 26, repeated his performance at St. Louis in 1904, and once again swept the jumping events at the 1908 Olympic Games in London.
When Wilma Rudolph was four, she caught scarlet fever and pneumonia.  It was thought she would never walk again.  Yet, her mother drove her long distances to therapy, and her brothers and sisters spent many hours massaging her useless legs.  By age six, she was walking in special shoes.  But Wilma did not stop there.  In high school, she starred in basketball.  Switching to track, she made the Olympic Games team in 1956 and won two bronze medals.  In 1960, she returned from the Games with three gold medals.  She was a winner personally, too, being one of the most popular athletes of all time.
Like most boys growing up in Flint, Michigan, trying out for Little League was an important part of life for young Jim Abbott.  The fact that he did not have a right hand made no difference.  At an early age he had learned to pitch and bat lefthanded.  When catching a ball in the field, he wore the glove on his left hand, quickly switching it to his right as he threw the runners out.  At the University of Michigan, Jim pitched his way to many honors, including the Big Ten Player of the Year.  As a member of the 1988 Olympic Games team, he made two appearances on the mound.  In the final game against Japan, he pitched a complete game to clinch the gold medal for the USA.  He was no longer thought of as a player with one hand.  Although Jim had reached his lifetime goal of earning an Olympic Games gold medal, he continued his athletic career by pitching in professional Major League Baseball.

"Title: Salt Lake City, Utah
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students will learn about the history of the city where the 2002 Winter Olympic Games are scheduled to take place.
Directions: In the Past
Salt Lake City was founded in 1847 by Brigham Young and many of his Mormon followers.  In the mid-1800s the city became a supply depot for the pioneers who were traveling to California.  The area also had a strong mining industry and later developed railroads that helped the city to become a business hub in the West.
Salt Lake City Today
Salt Lake City (located in the western United States) is the largest city in Utah.  According to the 1990 census, its population was 159,936.  The city is located in a valley surrounded by the Wasatch and Oquirrh mountains.
Salt Lake City is the world headquarters of the Mormon church (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints).  The Mormon Temple and the Mormon Tabernacle are located in the center of the city.
The University of Utah and Westminster College are located in Salt Lake City.  It is also the home of many cultural groups, such as the Utah Symphony Orchestra, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and several ballet and opera companies.
Salt Lake residents have a variety of sports teams to follow, including the Utah Grizzlies (hockey), the Utah Jazz (NBA), the Utah Blitzz (soccer), and the Utah Starzz (WNBA).
Outdoor activities are also extremely popular in the area.  Within 50 miles, there are four ski resorts, including Solitude, Brighton, Snowbird, and Alta.  These areas are frequented in the summer months as well for hiking, mountain biking, and rock climbing.
Activities

Have your students research Salt Lake City's past, searching for information about the city's agricultural and mining industries, as well as the supply depot that was so valuable to the westward traveling pioneers in the 1800s.
Allow each student to select an area of interest concerning Salt Lake's modern-day entertainment activities.  A student may want to research snow skiing in the area, the cultural events, or a popular sports team from Utah.
Duplicate and distribute copies of the Utah map on page 21.  Have your students use the map to answer the questions.

"Title: Sand Painting
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies, United States History, Art, Mediums
Objective: Students will create an artistic representation of the Navajo ideal of hozho.
Directions: Culture Clues
The Navajo have many rituals and ceremonies.  Most of them are related to the Navajo concept of hozho.  This single word has a very complex meaning.  It conveys ideas about beauty, goodness, happiness, and harmony.  It is a summary of the highest value and final goal of the Navajo people.  
The world is full of good things, but there are also many bad things.  A person might be contaminated by one of these evil elements.  The purpose of the Navajo rituals is to help the individual overcome bad influences and restore hozho.  These ceremonies are called Chantways.  If the Chantway ritual, which could last up to nine days, was correctly performed.  The Navajo believed that the Holy People would notice and take action to cure the patient.
The rituals called Blessingway were not to restore hozho but to promote it.  Different occasions, like protecting the herds of sheep or a new marriage, had Blessingway ceremonies.  The ritual began at sundown and continued uninterrupted for two nights and one day.
In some rituals a dry painting or sand painting was made from dried pigments.  The materials were shaped into patterns on the floor of the patient's hogan.  The size ranged from less than 1 foot (31 cm) to 20 feet (6 m) in diameter.  It took many hours to create each sand painting.  At the end of the ritual, what remained of the painting was destroyed.  The Navajo believed that the reason for the painting's existence had ended.
Activity
Draw an original design on the poster board.  Look at pictures of Navajo designs for ideas about how the picture should look.  Sample designs are provided on the activity page.
Use crayons to lightly color the design.  The Navajo traditionally used black, red, white, and yellow for their sand paintings.  
Apply white glue to all areas that will be a particular color.  Sprinkle that color of sand generously over the glue.  
When the glue is dry, shake off the excess sand.
Continue until you have used all the colors.
On a piece of paper, write about your design.  What is the purpose of your painting?  How does it reflect the Navajo ideal of hozho?

"Title: Angelina and Sarah Grimke: Sisters of Social Reform
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students learn about women in history who worked to abolish slavery.  They learn about the importance of goals and ambitions.
Directions: This activity can be done as part of a Women's History Month unit, or as a standalone activity.
Begin by introducing students to the Grimke sisters.  Ask them, if they knew that in the early history of the United States many African Americans were kidnapped and brought to be sold as personal slaves of wealthy landowners in the United States,  These people had very few rights and were often used and abused by their owners.  Their struggle for freedom was aided by two very unlikely women in the early 1830s.
Angelina and Sarah Grimke grew up in a wealthy South Carolina family who owned land and slaves.  Instead of taking the slaves for granted, they viewed them as equal playmates and friends.  Sarah even taught many how to read and write. She could not bear to see them physically punished or abused and spoke out against it whenever she could. 
As the two sisters grew older, they knew that they had to do something to stop the abuse of slaves.  Women during those days could not vote or speak in public in many towns along the Eastern seaboard.  Their task would be a difficult one.  They risked everything, including their lives, to travel north to launch a campaign to educate people about the injustice of slavery.
On one occasion Angelina addressed a group of men and women gathered in Boston before a State Legislative Committee.  Her topic was ""Abolition,"" the elimination of slavery.  People became so angry at her words about equality and the dignity of every human being that they burned down the building in which she gave her speech.
A few years later, Sarah, frustrated with the violent discrimination her sister had experienced when she spoke against slavery, wrote a book advocating equality for women.  Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Other Essays argued for equal rights for women under the law.  Without her landmark effort perhaps it would have taken even many more years for women to gain the right to vote that they finally won in 1920.  Both of these women were early pioneers in social reform that continues in our country today.
Suggested Activities

Discussion Questions
    
Knowledge: What did Angelina and Sarah do to inform people about the injustices of slavery?
Comprehension: Was slavery abolished because of the efforts of these two sisters?
Creative Thinking: While slavery was outlawed during the the Civil War, some people claim that they are still treated like slaves.  Can society or another person enslave others today?
Application: How can you stop discrimination?
Analysis: Can people today do anything to help others succeed when they are treated unfairly because of their sex or race?
Synthesis: Why did this biographical sketch deal with both sex and race?
Evaluation: Have you ever experienced discrimination?  How did you feel?  Were the Grimke sisters justified in breaking laws in order to help others?
Affective: Would you risk everything in your life so that someone else might gain something? Would you dedicate your life to helping others?  Why?


Skills Focus
    
Language and Communication Skills: Write two sentences describing why all people in the United States should be equal.
Independent Study Skills: Are there others who have worked for equality in your lifetime?  Go to the library and investigate terms such as ""Equal Rights,"" ""Voting Rights Acts,"" ""Title Nine,"" and ""Civil Rights Legislation.""
Manipulative Skills: Write and illustrate a story to read aloud to a younger student in your school.  Read the story to the student.  Then help the student read the story you have written.
Journalism - Advertising
        
Come One, Come All!:  Prepare a poster inviting the community to go to hear a lecture by the Grimke sisters about the opposition of slavery.  Be sure to give the time and place.  How would you make the reader want to go to the speech through the poster alone?

"Title: The Story of Last Names
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies, Ancient History
Objective: Students learn about the origins of last names in Medieval times.
Directions: Introduce to students ""The Story of Last Names.""
A long time ago, four men named Thomas lived in a little town.  That was the only name any of them had.  In those days, only kings and nobles had last names; most men and women had only first names.
Because the men had the same name, here's how people told them apart.  One Thomas had a father named John, so he was called ""Thomas, John's son.""  Another Thomas, a baker, was called ""Thomas the Baker.""  The third Thomas had light-colored hair, so he was known as ""Thomas the White.""  And the fourth Thomas lived next to the village green, so he was known to everyone as ""Thomas of the Green.""
Time went on.  Thomas the Baker married a girl named Elaine.  She became known as ""Elaine, Thomas the Baker's wife.""  They had a little boy named John, and he was known as ""John, Thomas the Baker's son.""  But after a while, people got tired of saying all those words.  So they simply called Thomas the Baker, ""Thomas Baker.""  His wife became Elaine Baker, and their son was John Baker.
That's how last names came to be.  People took their fathers' first names, the names of their fathers' jobs, the names of the places where they lived, or names that told how they looked.  They put these names after their first names.  When a man married, his wife and children took his last name.  Sometimes, a widow or single woman might adopt children and give them her last name.  So, today, our last names can tell us something about the people we got them from long ago.
Ask students to pay close attention to see if their last names are on one of the following lists.  Here are some examples of patronymics, last names that come from first names:





Adding son or sen


Adding s


Adding es, ez, or is

            Jones




            Wilson


            Walters


            Rodriguez





People who spoke different languages sometimes added sohn, wicz, vich, or ak to the end of a name.  All of these mean ""son.""  People from some countries put son in front of their fathers' names.  Mac, Mc, and Fitz all mean ""son of.""

"Title: I Want to Be Just Like You!
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: The student will explore biographical information to gain new knowledge about people of eminence; compare and contrast people of eminence; recognize the differences between being great and being famous; identify a personality whom he/she would most like to emulate; and participate in a self-examination in order to set goals which will bring him/her closer to recognizing a personal improvement goal.
Directions: Background
Through a study of people of eminence, our students come to a closer relationship with history because much of it can be appreciated on a more personal level than when it is studied through dates and battles and events. Attaching a face and a name to a movement or period in history and experiencing that individual's struggle can promote new levels of understanding. 

Activity One
Compare and Contrast-What similarities and differences are there among people of eminence?

Activity Two
Famous or Great?-Is there a difference between being ""famous"" and being ""great""?

Activity Three
From Here to There-What would I have to do in order to become more like one of these people I admire?
Have the students work on the activity pages in order to be able to respond to these key questions.

"Title: Janet Guthrie
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students will learn about a woman physicist and race car driver in honor of Women's History Month.  They will identify other well-known women daredevils.
Directions: Race Car Driver and Physicist
Why would a well-educated young woman choose a career as a mechanic and race car driver?  Janet Guthrie's family and friends would never understand why a woman who had a wonderful job as a physicist in the aerospace department of Republic Aviation would want to throw away her life on racing cars.
Janet's love for adventure led her to the racing world.  She sold everything she owned, including her XK-120 Jaguar.  Her goal was to build her own race car from scratch.  She bought a brand new Toyota and promptly tore it down.  It took her a year to rebuild it so that it would be able to compete.  Since she had no steady job, life was a struggle.  She had to abandon her apartment for a single room in the back of a store.  Only odd jobs kept her alive and paid for the parts she needed for her car.  Finally, worn out and virtually penniless, Janet took a job as a technical editor for Sperry Rand.
Although she could find no racing sponsor, she did not give up.  She kept making appointments and attempting to sell the world on the idea of a female race car driver, but sponsors thought a woman was too much of a risk.  Finally, someone took a chance and asked her to race.  She finished that race and continued to win in club races and some professional ones.  At last Janet set her sights on a race that would test her endurance: the Indianapolis 500.
In 1976 Janet attempted to qualify for the Indy 500, but car problems eliminated her.  But that same year she did become the first woman to race for the National Association for Stock Car Auto Races.  In 1977 she became the first woman to race in the Indy 500; the following year she placed ninth in her Texaco-sponsored #51 racer at Indianapolis.
Janet Guthrie is a pioneer.  The thrill of racing caused her to decide that a life driving off into the sunset was better than sitting at a desk.  Her spirit of adventure paid off not only for her but also for every other woman whose career leads her to the speedway.
Suggested Activities

Knowledge: What kinds of jobs did Janet do before and while she worked toward becoming a race car driver?
Creative Thinking: If you wanted to become a race car driver, how would you find someone to sponsor you?
Application: Draw your conception of the fastest race car of the future.
Analysis: Why was it so difficult for Janet to find a sponsor and become a professional race car driver?
Synthesis: Did Janet's experiences before her professional career as race car driver help her in any way?
Evaluation: Do you think that Janet was happy with her life as a race car driver?
Affective: Do you think that racing cars is hazardous?  Do you think it is more hazardous for women than for men?

"Title: A Closer Look at a Fairy Tale
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Social Studies
Objective: Students compare the roles of male and female characters in fairy tales.
Directions: Once upon a time. . . Fairy tales have been passed down for generations.  Discuss with students the elements and background of fairy tales.  Fairy Tales contain elements of magic and are stories of good versus evil.  Originally, fairy tales were passed on by women as a way to teach lessons to children about life and behavior.  Later, the tales were written down by people like the Grimm Brothers to share as entertainment and as a study of folklore. Authors like Hans Christian Andersen wrote new tales to share with people.
Ask students to think of their favorite fairy tales.  Choose one to discuss with the class.  Ask students to describe the characters, who they are and how they act.  See if they can identify the lesson or moral of the fairy tale.  Lead the class into a discussion of how fairy tale lessons apply to society today.
Although some of the lessons taught in fairy tales are still important, many of the lessons are no longer valued in modern society. For example, many fairy tales tell the story of a beautiful but helpless woman who needs to be rescued by magic, or by a man.  Today, women and girls are encouraged to be more independent. 
Discuss with students the idea that although many fairy tales still contain valuable lessons, it is important to think about the messages in the tales and consider whether or not they are relevant in modern life.
Distribute copies of the A Closer Look at a Fairy Tale activity page.  Tell them that they will read a version of the fairy tale (as a class or individually).  On the activity page, they identify the roles of the male and female characters as well as the messages and lessons they find in the story.  When the students have finished, have a class discussion about what was discovered.

"Title: Buffalo Hide Pictographs
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students learn about  the Native American practice of writing stories on buffalo skins.  They learn about pictographs and use symbols to write their own stories
Directions: Discuss with students the fact that the Plains Indians depended on the buffalo (bison) for their existence.  The buffalo provided clothing, food, robes, blankets, tools, rugs, fuel, and eating utensils.  The Plains Indians respected the buffalo and always gave thanks for the buffalo's assistance in their way of life.  
Oftentimes, stories would be recorded on buffalo skins.  These stories were written in symbols known as pictographs.  Distribute to students copies of the Buffalo Hide reference page, which has examples of a number of pictographs.  Explain to them that they will use these pictographs to tell their own stories.
Directions for Creating the Buffalo Hides:
1.  Cut along one seam of the paper bag to open the bag into a large piece of paper.
2.  Using scissors or tearing (tearing looks more authentic), cut out a hide shape from the paper.
3.  Using crayons and the pictograph samples from the Buffalo Hide reference page, write a story on the bag.  Be sure to press very hard on the bag with the crayons.
4.  In a sink or bucket of water placed on a newspaper, dilute one cup (250 mL) of brown tempera paint.
5.  Lightly crumple the paper buffalo skin and immerse it in the tempera mixture.
6.  Knead the hide gently to remove excess water.
7.  Carefully open up the hide and lay it flat on newspapers to dry thoroughly.

"Title: Christmas in Great Britain
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Social Studies, World History
Objective: Students will learn about the Christmas customs in Great Britain.
Directions: Happy Christmas! is the traditional English Christmas greeting.  Many of the most popular Christmas customs in the world today come from Great Britain.  For example, the Christmas card originated in England, and some think that school children were the first to send them.  Away from home attending school, they would make and send beautiful cards informing their parents of their progress and hinting that gift-giving season was near.  The first Christmas card was printed in England in 1843, and its popularity grew.
""Wassailing"" is also a British custom.  Groups of people walk up and down the streets of their neighborhoods at Christmastime singing carols while sipping a hot punch-like drink.  The children in the group hope to receive treats while they sing.  Wassail means ""be in good health,"" and when a group of people drink wassail together, all quarreling is supposed to end.  Wassailing takes place most commonly during the twelve days of Christmas (between Christmas and January 6).  Traditionally, this whole period is a time of great revelry.
""Mumming"" is another English tradition.  People dress in costumes and masks to put on Christmas plays throughout the holiday season.  Sometimes Father Christmas joins in the festivities, too.
Before the English have their Christmas feast, they pull open Christmas ""crackers.""  These are paper cylinders filled with small prizes and riddles.  They make a noisy cracking sound when opened.  Sometimes they include paper hats which are to be worn around the holiday dinner table.
After dinner, the family goes to a sitting room to tell ghost stories or ""Christmas Tales.""  The most famous tale is Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.  There may be a Yule log in the fireplace, although this is not as large as it was many years ago.  In many homes today, candles have replaced blazing fires to represent the Star of Bethlehem and the Light of the World.
Boxing Day in England is on December 26.  In the past, people rewarded their good servants with gifts of money enclosed inside special boxes that were opened on the day after Christmas.  Today, this public holiday is still celebrated, but the ""Christmas boxes"" are given to community workers such as mail carriers.
Activities

Ghostly Christmas stories were popular in England.  Share some of these with your students, and then ask them to write their own ghost stories with a Christmas theme.  Illustrate them and put them in the school library to be shared with other classes.  
Practice the art of mumming.  Write a Christmas play and perform it for parents, using costumes and masks.
Make pomander balls.  To do so, each child will need one whole orange, whole cloves, and ribbon or yarn.  Push whole cloves into the orange peel until the entire orange is ""studded.""  Tie ribbon around the ball to make a sling and leave a length for hanging it.  Set it aside for several weeks to dry.  (Optional:  Place it inside a nylon bag to dry more evenly.)  Tighten the yarn hanger as necessary and hang in a room or closet for a wonderful scent.
Some famous English Christmas carols are included with the activity sheets.  Learn the songs, and then ask the students how they reflect English Christmas traditions.

Make Christmas Crackers
On a scraps of paper, have students write a riddle, joke, or lesson (moral) to be enclosed in the cracker.

Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: In this activity, students will create a multimedia project as the culmination of their study of the events of the American Revolution era.
Directions: Put the students into groups of two.  Give groups guidelines for their research which indicate what areas are to be covered.  In general, they are required to focus on major issues and events during each of the following years:  1754, 1763, 1765, 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1776, 1778, 1781, and 1783.  
The students must complete note cards to prepare their research.  They should have a separate card for each date on the time line with the date clearly written on each note card.  They need to write complete and thorough notes on each event.  Be sure they properly record the sources used on each note card.
Give the class a time line for the project.  The students do their research and design the actual project format.  The project must include a title page, a bibliography, a table of contents, and eleven slides/scenes/cards (one for each year).  It must also include a graphic downloaded from the Internet, graphic imported from a clip art, at least two scanned graphics, text, an animated graphic, sound, and a digitized movie.  
Students should use the Group Project Guidelines (page 125) as a checklist while they complete the project.  The Self and Partner Evaluation (page 126) makes a nice assessment after the project is completed.
Extension
Students can extend their research into areas that especially interest them.  They can also stretch the technological boundaries by including more scanned images or integrating digital movies more fully.

"Title: Countries of Africa
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Social Studies, Geography
Objective: Students learn about the different countries of Africa.
Directions: Discuss with students the origins of African American history month.  In 1926, a scholar named Carter Woodson felt that African Americans did not know about the achievements of their collective past.  He instituted Negro History Week as a time to learn about and celebrate these past achievements.  In 1976, this celebration became a month-long one, and is seen as a time to reflect on achievements and contributions that may still be too little known. 
This activity can be used as an introduction to the origins of African Americans, and as a study of the continent in the past and today.
Make one set of country cards by cutting out the six cards and the six flags from the activity pages. Glue them back to back.
Divide the class into six groups. Distribute one country card to each group and a map of Africa to each student. Give each group time to read the information on their card and research further information about the country. Have each student color the country on the map of Africa, write a paragraph about it, and draw pictures of its flag and main products.
Regroup the class so that students with the same countries are in different groups. Have students take turns presenting their countries to the group. If necessary, let students check the country cards for extra information.
Extension Ideas:

Have each student make a full set of country cards. Color the flags using an encyclopedia for reference.
Have students combine their map pages to make a Big Book. Make dividers for each of the countries.

About This Site: Students select a topic (News) from the search engine home page and then link to any one of several news-related links.
Pre-Internet Activity:
Assign students the task of watching the evening news at home.  They discuss with their parents the details of one of the stories that interests them and then they write a one-paragraph summary of the story of interest.  Allow time for the students to share their reports with the class.  Discuss, also, the manner in which the reporter communicated the story: What was her attitude? How was she dressed? Where did she stand? In which direction did she face? Did her face give away any hints as to how she felt about the story? etc.  Explain that each student will have a chance to gather the latest ""scoop"" off the Internet and report the news to the class in a professional manner like a real-life news reporter.
Teaching the Lesson:
Assign students news partners.  They will have the same partners throughout the school year.  Each week, have the class scan the headlines for interesting news items.  Set aside fifteen minutes for the students to share what's going on in the world that interests them and discuss the stories.  In addition, allow a different pair each week to go online to obtain a news story to share with 
the class.
Each pair needs a copy of page 132.  Write one of the following category links on the line entitled ""Today's news category.""




 Current Events   
 Newswires   


 International   
 Television   


 Newspapers

"Title: Create-a-Town Simulation
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Oral Language, Listening, Speaking, Social Studies, Geography, Art, Mediums, Techniques
Objective: Students will work together to create a small town.  After the construction of the town, the students can learn about all the aspects of town life by further working on their new creation.
Directions: Tiny Town Materials
There are several ways that Tiny Town can be constructed.  Use whatever works best for you.  Remember that valuable measuring and directional skills are involved in this process.  You will have to consider various factors, such as the following:  class size, student ability, and available adult help.
These factors will help you determine whether you want to have the children measure and cut the brown paper strips for the roads or have a teacher's assistant or parent volunteer do it ahead of time.  Prior to making the roads, you may want to show a video or movie on how roads are constructed. 
Form teams with four to six children on each team.  Carefully select children with different abilities to help contribute to the teamwork on each team.  For example, a child who is not strong academically could be the caretaker of the materials.  He or she would be responsible for having everything ready for the team to begin work.
Directions

Have each team fold the green paper exactly in half lengthwise and in half again in the other direction.

Have students cut out the directional words (North, East, West, South) on page 11.  Reduce or enlarge signs as needed.  Have them decide the correct placement for each sign.  (Give them a hint: Each sign will be on one of the creases they just made.)  Point out that the four main directions spell out the word n-e-w-s.  Please be sure all four signs are at the edge of the paper to allow adequate space for Tiny Town.  When the four signs are correctly placed, the students may glue them on the paper.
Next, use the brown butcher paper to design the streets.  The paper should be 1 yard wide and 1 yard, 30 inches long.  See page 12 for placement of the streets, driveways, and parking lots.  Each 'lane' is two inches wide.  Use a yellow pencil to make a dashed line exactly down the middle of each street (as real streets have).  If it is not exactly in the middle, the toy cars will be driven illegally on the yellow line.  Next, use a white pencil to make the edges to represent curbs. Then cut out the 'Street Signs' on page 11 and glue or tape them onto each street.
Glue the streets to the green paper according to the Tiny Town Street Layout on page 13.

"Title: Casting Out Nines
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.), Problem Solving
Objective: Students learn how to determine whether or not a division problem will have a remainder.
Directions: 

Some quotients (answers in division) have no remainders.  You can tell before you do the problem if a division problem will have a remainder.
Rule: If the divisor is 9 and all of the digits in the dividend add up to 9 or a multiple of 9, there will be no remainder in the quotient.
Examples



 1.   
 63/9   
 6 plus 3 equals 9. The quotient is 7 with no remainder.   


 2.   
 4,536/9   
 Together the digits in the dividend add up to  18 (4 + 5 + 3 + 6), a multiple of 9.   The quotient is 504 with no remainder.   


 3.   
 27,918/9   
 Together the digits in the dividend add up to 27,  a multiple of 9. The quotient is 3,102 with no remainder.   


 4.   
 15,318/9   
 Together the digits add up to 18, a multiple of 9. The quotient is 1,702 with no remainder.   


 5.   
 3,617/9   
 Together the digits add up to 17, which is not a multiple of 9. The quotient is 401 with a remainder of 8.   


 6.   
 3,67_/9   
 What digit will go in the empty space to make this dividend divisible by 9? The answer is 2 because this will make the digit total in the dividend equal 18 which is a multiple of 9.

"Title: Common Factors and Common Multiples and Simple Exponents
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Numbers and Numerations, Algebra and Function, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.)
Objective: Students learn about factors and multiples.
Directions: Common Factors
Give students the following information about factors:
A factor is a number which divides evenly into another number.  The number 6 divides evenly into 12.  It is a factor of 12.
When two numbers are multiplied, they are factors of the answer.
In the equation 2 x 6 = 12, the numbers 2 and 6 are factors of 12.
The number 1 is always a factor of every number.
A common factor is a number which is a factor of two different products.
Since the number 6 is a factor of 12 and a factor of 18, it is a common factor of both numbers.
Write this sample on the board, and see if students can guess the common factors.
The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.
The common factors are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
Common Multiples
A multiple is the number made when any two factors are multiplied together.  It is the product of two factors.
In the equation 2 x 6 = 12, the number 12 is a multiple of 2 and 6.
A common multiple is a number that is a product of the same factor as another number.
The number 12 is a common multiple of both 2 and 3.
The number 6 is a common multiple of both 2 and 3.
The number 18 is a common multiple of both 2 and 3.
Some common multiples of 2 and 3 are 6, 12, and 18.

"Title: How to Calculate Time
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Measurement (includes Time)
Objective: Students learn to calculate time with clocks, calendars, and eras.
Directions: Give students the following information about computing time with clocks, calendars, and eras.
Facts to Know
Time
a.m. = morning - 12:00 a.m. (midnight) to 11:59 a.m.
p.m. = afternoon - 12:00 p.m. (noon) to 11:59 p.m. 
60 seconds = 1 minute
60 minutes = 1 hour
24 hours = 1 day
To compute elapsed time within the morning or within the afternoon, subtract the smaller number from the larger number.  Remember to regroup (borrow) with 60 minutes.
Sample
Because you cannot subtract 0 minutes from 38 minutes, subtract 1 hour from the 9:00 p.m. and convert it to 60 minutes.  So when you calculate how much time elapsed between 9:00 p.m. and 7:38 p.m., the final answer is 1 hour 22 minutes.
9:00 p.m.  (or  8:60min) - 7:38 p.m. = 1:22 (or 1 hr 22 min)
To add elapsed time, add the two measurements of time together.
Sample
When you add the two measurements of time together, you have an answer of 218 days 49 hrs 60 min, but you know that you convert some of the minutes to hours and some hours into days.  Using the chart at the top of the page, you know that 24 hours = 1 day so 49 hours = 2 days 1 hour.  Similarly, you know that 60 minutes = 1 hour so after you made all the conversions, the final answer is 220 days and 2 hours have elapsed.
206 days    2 hrs    5 min + 12 days  47 hrs  55 min =   218 days  49 hrs  60 min (or 220 days  2 hrs)

Description: Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.)
Objective: Students will learn to estimate quotients and check their division with multiplication.
Directions: Estimating Quotients
You can determine if an answer in division is reasonable by learning to estimate the answers.
Sample

Round the divisor to the nearest 10 or 100, depending on how many digits are in the divisor.  In the sample problem, the divisor 27 rounds to 30.
Round the dividend to the nearest 10, 100, or 1,000 so that all of the digits, except the first one are zeros.  In the sample problem, the dividend 630 rounds to 600.
Divide 600 by 30.  The answer is 20.
Compare your estimate to the exact answer to determine if the exact answer is reasonable.


The estimate of 20 and the exact answer of 23 R9 are close so the estimated answer is reasonably close to the actual answer.
Helpful Hint:  The estimate and the exact answer will usually have the same number of digits.
Check Division with Multiplication

Division and multiplication are inverse or opposite operations.  You can use multiplication to check your division answer this way.

Do the division problem.
Multiply the quotient times the divisor.
If there is a remainder, add it to the multiplication product.
Compare this answer to the dividend.  They should be the same number (630 = 630).

Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Problem Solving
Objective: Students will learn how to recognize extra information in word problems.
Directions: Facts to Know
Sometimes a problem has extra information that students do not need to solve the problem.  Before students start these problems, ask them these four important questions:

What does the problem ask you to find?
What information is needed to solve the problem?
How can you show the problem with numbers?
What is your answer?

Sample A
At the art fair, Libby bought a mug of root beer for $1, a veggie burger for $2, a hot fudge sundae for $2, and a piece of pottery for $5.  How much did Libby spend on food?
First, have students focus on the information they need to answer the question being asked.  Then they can identify the extra information that is not necessary for answering the question because it has no effect on the answer.
In the problem above, the question is about money spent on food.  So the extra information is that Libby bought a piece of pottery for $5.  Now, they can solve the problem using only the information that's necessary.  $1 + $2 + $2 = $5-Libby spent $5 on food.
Sample B
Erica and her friends had a pizza party.  They ordered 8 pizzas.  1/2 of the pizzas were large combo pizzas, 1/4 of the pizzas were medium specialty pizzas, and  1/4 were medium pepperoni pizzas.  They also ordered five 2-liter sodas for $1.50 each.  How many medium pepperoni pizzas did Erica and her friends order?

In the problem above, the question is about how many medium pepperoni pizzas were ordered.  So the extra information is how many sodas and large combo pizzas were ordered by Erica and her friends.  Now you can solve the problem using only the information that's necessary.  Erica and her friends ordered 2 medium pepperoni pizzas.  1/2 of 8 pizzas is 4 pizzas; 1/4 of 8 pizzas is 2 pizzas

"Title: Making Decisions with Probability
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Data Analysis and Probability
Objective: Students learn about probability.
Directions: Facts to Know
Probability is a term used in mathematics to explain the chance that a future event will occur, or the likelihood of an outcome.  Think to yourself.  What is the likelihood of you eating ice cream today?  Will it definitely happen?  Will it definitely not happen?  Will it perhaps happen?  Probability helps us assign a numerical value to the likelihood of future events or outcomes. Some events, such as the sun rising each day, are certain.  They have a probability of 100% or 1. Some events, such as a dog flying through the air, are impossible.  They have a probability of 0% or 0.
Some events, such as catching a cold, may occur or may not occur.  Depending on a number of outside influences, this particular event may be likely or unlikely.  This likelihood may be assigned a number between 0% and 100% or between 0 and 1.  For example, if you are usually pretty healthy, and you have been eating right all winter and dressing appropriately when you go outside, you may think you only have about a 10% chance of catching a cold.  But if you have been around a lot of friends and family members who have had colds, or if you usually catch a cold every winter, you may think you have about an 80% chance of catching a cold.
For some events, which have only two outcomes, such as flipping a coin, the likelihood of either outcome is equally likely.  This means there is an equal chance that these events will occur or not occur.  They fall right in the middle and have a probability of 50%, .5, or 1/2.
In the case of the flipping coin, either heads or tails will appear.  The likelihood of each outcome is equal.
Similarity, if the forecast calls for a 50% chance of rain, the meteorologist is telling you that there is an equally likely chance of rain and no rain.

Objective: Students learn how to determine temperature on a thermometer and learn about both the Fahreneheit and Celsius scales.
Directions: Introduce the following facts to students.

The temperature on a thermometer is determined by finding the level of the red mercury in the tube and the number on the temperature scale across from it.
The temperature is written in numbers with the ° sign.  For example, 70° F is read: 70 degrees Fahrenheit.


Fahrenheit

The Fahrenheit scale records the freezing point of water at 32° F and the boiling point of water at 212° F (at sea level).
The temperature is usually reported in degrees Fahrenheit in newspapers, on the radio, and on television.
    Celsius

The Celsius scale is based on the freezing point of water at 0° C and a boiling point of water at 100° C (at sea level).
The Celsius thermometer is usually used by scientists.


    Show students examples of Fahrenheit and Celsius thermomter.

    Go over the following examples with students.
    Sample A
    A Fahrenheit thermometer has a reading of 68°, a normal room temperature.  How much above freezing is this?  To find the answer, subtract 32 (the freezing point of water) from 68.
    The answer is 36 degrees above the freezing point of water, or 36° F.
    Sample B
    How many degrees below freezing is -10° F?

Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.)
Objective: Students will learn easy methods of multiplying by 10, 100, and 1000.
Directions: Facts to Know
You can use mental math to multiply by 10.  With practice you can probably multiply these problems in your head as quickly as you can use a calculator!
To multiply any number by 10, just add a zero to the number being multiplied.
If you have 10 bags of candy and each bag has 32 candies, you would have 320 candies altogether.
Sample A
32 x 10 = 320
To multiply any number by 100, just add two zeros to the number being multiplied.
If you have 100 hundred bags and each bag has 45 marbles, you would have a total of 4500 marbles.
Sample B
100  x 45 = 4,500
To multiply any number by 1000, just add three zeros to the number being multiplied.
Sample C
1000  x 3569 = 3,569,000
Shortcut to Finding the Product When Factors Are Multiples of 10
When one or more of the numbers being multiplied are multiples of 10, follow these steps:

Multiply the parts of each factor that are not zeros. 




    (2 x 12 = 24)


For each of the numbers being multiplied, find the number of zeros from left to right (before reaching a non-zero number) and add the same number of zeros to the product.  (In this example, there are 9 zeros.  The product should have 9 zeros.)

Objective: Students use coin values to solve problems.
Directions: Introduce the lesson by showing students a variety of coins and coin combinations.

Bertha Biggspender broke open her piggy bank.
She had a total of seven coins worth $0.19.
Which coins did she have?


To solve problems of this type, you need to know three things:

the number of coins
the total amount of money
any kinds of coins not included


Pennies First
Always do the pennies first in these problems.  To have $0.19, Bertha had to have at least 4 pennies because pennies are the only coins which could be used for the last four cents.  This leaves $0.15 to be accounted for and three remaining coins.  The only coins which will work for this combination of money are three nickels.
Make a Chart
Record the information on a chart like this:





            Number of Coins


            Amount of Money




            4 pennies


            $0.04




            3 nickels


            $0.15




            Totals:  7 coins


            $0.19





Challenging Problems
Bertha Biggspender found her wallet which had seven coins worth $0.91.  
She did not have any dimes or half dollars.  Which coins did she have?
Do the pennies first--she had to have at least one penny.  There were not enough coins to have more than one penny.  She has six coins which equal $0.90.  She had no dimes and no half dollars so the combination must include only quarters and nickels.  A total of three quarters and three nickels will work.





            Number of Coins


            Amount of Money




            1 penny


            $0.01




            3 quarters

"Title: How to Apply Properties in Multiplication
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.), Problem Solving
Objective: Students learn about the Commutative and Associative Properties of Multiplication.
Directions: Facts to Know
Commutative Property
The Commutative Property of Multiplication states that when the order of the factors is changed, the product stays the same.  Multiplication is a commutative operation.  In the equation 2 x 4 = 4 x 2, for example, the order of the factors does not affect the answer 
(4 x 2 = 8 and 2 x 4 = 8).
The commutative property works for any number of factors.  Study the following samples:
Sample A
5 x 6 x 7 = 7 x 6 x 5
5 x 6 x 7 = 210
7 x 6 x 5 = 210
Sample B
70 x 90 = 6,300
90 x 70 = 6,300
Sample C
30 x 50 = 50 x 30
30 x 50 = 1,500
50 x 30 = 1,500
Associative Property
The Associative Property of Multiplication states that when the grouping of the factors is changed, the product stays the same.  Multiplication is associative.  The way the factors are grouped with parentheses does not affect the answer.  Study the following samples:
Sample D
2 x (3 x 4) = (2 x 3) x 4
2 x (3 x 4) = 24
(2 x 3) x 4 = 24
Sample E
6 x (7 x 9) = (6 x 7) x 9
6 x (7 x 9) = 378
(6 x 7) x 9 = 378
Sample F
4 x (5 x 6) = (4 x 5) x 6 
4 x (5 x 6) = 120
(4 x 5) x 6 = 120

"Title: How to Use the Rules of Divisibility and Estimation
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Numbers and Numerations, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.)
Objective: Students learn that there are rules that make division easier because of a pattern which indicates that a certain dividend is divisible by a certain divisor.
Directions: Tell students that when they are working on division problems, there are rules that they can utilize to make their problem solving easier.  These rules are based on patterns within the numbers.  Explain to students the following rules, writing the examples on the board as you go along.
If the divisor is 2, the rule is that a number is divisible by 2 if the last digit of the dividend (or ones digit) is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.  For example, 42 ÷ 2 = 21.
If the divisor is 3, the rule is that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of the digits in the dividend is divisible by 3.  For example, 126: 1 + 2 + 6 = 9; 9 is divisible by 3, so 126 is divisible by 3.
If the divisor is 4, the rule is that a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits of the dividend is divisible by four.  For example, 428: the last two digits are 28; 28 is divisible by 4, so 428 is divisible by 4.
If the divisor is 5, the rule is that a number is divisible by 5 if the last digit of the dividend is 0 or 5.  For example, 115 is divisible by 5 but 412 is not divisible by 5.
If the divisor is 6, the rule is that a number is divisible by 6 if the dividend is divisible by 2 and 3.  For example, 642: ones digit is even so it is divisible by 2, and the sum of the digits 6 + 4 + 2 = 12, which is divisible by 3, so 642 is divisible by 6.
If the divisor is 9, the rule is that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of the digits in the dividend is divisible by 9.  For example, 693: the sum of the digits 6 + 9 + 3 = 18; 18 is divisible by 9, so 693 is divisible by 9.  
If the divisor is 10, the rule is that a number is divisible by 10 if the last digit (or ones digit) is 0.  For example, 250: the last digit of the number is 0, so 250 is divisible by 10.

A sequence is a set of numbers that follows a mathematical rule and a specific order.  This is a simple sequence:  
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, . . .)
Odd numbers create a sequence following a specific arrangement:
(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . .)
Sequences can be used with all four operations and with combinations of operations.
Multiplication Sequences
Here is a multiplication sequence called the doubling sequence:
(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . .)
Multiplication sequences are also called geometric progressions.  The multiplication sequence below involves square numbers.  It is the square of each of the counting numbers.
(1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, . . .)
Declining Sequences
Sequences with subtraction and division decline from higher to lower numbers.
(28, 25, 22, 19, 16, 13, . . .) -- The rule is:  (n - 3).
(88, 44, 22, 11, . . .) -- The rule is:  (n ÷ 2).
Harder Sequences
Some sequences use two operations like this one -- (5, 11, 23, 47, 95, . . .)
The operations are multiply by 2 and add 1.  The rule can be written this way:  (n x 2) + 1
This sequence also employs two operations -- (5, 9, 17, 33, 65, . . .)
The operations are multiply by 2 and subtract 1.  The rule can be written this way:  (n x 2) - 1
Fibonacci Sequences
The most famous sequence is called the Fibonacci sequence.  The first two numbers are 1.  Every number after that is the sum of the preceding two numbers.  Sequences can be designed to follow this Fibonacci pattern.

The rule can be written this way:  (a x 2) + 1.
Multiplication sequences are also called geometric progressions.
Exponents
When a number is to be multiplied by itself, it can be written as an exponent.
The exponent is the small raised number which tells how many times to multiply the base number by itself.
Sample A
52 means multiply 5 times 5.
5 is the base number.
The raised number 2 is the exponent.  It also indicates that 5 is being raised to the second power.
Sample B
53 = 5 x 5 x 5
This indicates that 5 is to be multiplied by itself, and the answer (25) is to be multiplied again by 5.
5 x 5 = 25
25 x 5 = 125
53 = 125
Sample C
34 = 3 x 3 x 3 x 3
This exponent (or the raised number) indicates that 3 is to be multiplied by 3.
The answer (9) is to be multiplied by 3 again.
The answer (27) is to be multiplied by 3 again.
3 x 3 = 9
9 x 3 = 27

Step 2: State the problem to be solved.  Restate the problem in your own words.  Use the fewest possible words to describe what you have to find out.
Step 3: Determine the operation to be used.  There are only four operations: addition, subtraction, multipication, and division.  Choose the most likely operation using the clues you have found.  (See the secret code words.)
Step 4: Do the operation.  Check to see that you made no careless errors and that your work is accurate.
Step 5: Check the answer to see if it is reasonable.  Compare your answer to the original problem to see if it makes sense.
Students should use the secret code words to help them select the correct operation.
Addition Secret Code Words: altogether, in all, sum, perimeter, entire cost, total, total cost
Subtraction Secret Code Words: change, how much more, difference, how much less, how many fewer, minus, how much left, how much saved, how much taller
Multiplication Secret Code Words: times, compute the area, product, find the volume, percent, of (fractions), percent of discount, percent of tax, times as many as 
Division Secret Code Words: split evenly, divided by, quotient, find the average, shooting percentage, shared evenly

Students should decide whether they will make monthly payments or pay for their cars in full, using money in their savings or checking accounts.  If students purchase their cars, they will not have any monthly car payments.  Therefore, the value recorded on their Transportation Summaries will be zero.  Point out that they will still have to pay for car insurance and gasoline.
Write the following gas prices on the chalkboard or have students determine what the price of each grade of gas is in your community and write that information on the chalkboard.





 Gas Prices   


 $1.14 per gallon (3.79 liters) of regular unleaded   


 $1.20 per gallon (3.79 liters) of mid-grade unleaded   


 $1.35 per gallon (3.79 liters) of premium unleaded   






Tell students to calculate the amount of money they spend on gas if they use 18 gallons per week.  After students have calculated the weekly cost of gasoline, have them multiply that value by four to get the monthly cost.  Remind them to record the monthly value on their Transportation Summary forms.
Have students calculate the cost, insurance, and gasoline for a second car if their families need vehicles for their spouses.
Encourage students to draw pictures of their family cars.
As an alternative to drawing pictures, you may wish to have students make collages, using car pictures from newspapers and magazines.
Remind each student to write the total estimated transportation expenses on his or her Family Profile Recording Sheet (page 10).  Be sure students write monthly and yearly estimates.  Point out that yearly estimates can be obtained by multiplying the monthly estimates by 12.

Follow-Up Activities

If possible, arrange to take students to a car manufacturing plant.  As an alternative, you could arrange a field trip to an automotive repair or body shop.
Have students do research to learn about vehicles that run on alternative fuel sources such as natural gas, electricity, solar power, human power, and hydrogen.
You may wish to have students investigate to learn what the different advantages and disadvantages of purchasing and leasing automobiles might be.
Obtain automobile accident report forms from an insurance company and the local police department.  Reproduce these forms.  Give students the experience of filling out these forms.
Arrange to take students to traffic court.  Tell them to take notes during the hearings.  Discuss students' observations of the process.  Ask them what they think works well and what they think can be done to make improvements.
Have students do research to determine how gas is obtained, how it is processed, how it gets to the pumps, and how the price is established.
Provide students with outline maps of the world on which they can write.  Have them do research to learn where the world's largest oil deposits are found.  Ask them to color and label these locations on their maps.
Have students keep a log of how much gas their real-life family uses and how many miles they travel using that amount of gas.  Show students how to calculate how many miles per gallon a car gets.  Ask them to figure out how many miles per gallon their cars get.  If a student does not have a car, tell him/her to use a classmate's log to do the calculations.  Then allow the class to work together to rank students' cars in order from best gas mileage to worst gas mileage.
Make a class graph that shows what kinds of vehicles each student's family owns.  These can be divided into groups by vehicle models such as pickup trucks, motorcycles, two-door cars, four-door sedans, station wagons, sport utility vehicles, and sports cars, or they can be classified by the names of vehicle makers.
Encourage students to design the cars of their dreams.  Allow them to use their imaginations to draw diagrams for any kinds of cars they think they would like to drive.  Students may enjoy making models of their dream cars.  Invite volunteers to share their diagrams or models.

"Title: Work with Basic Units of Time
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Measurement (includes Time)
Objective: Students review fundamental concepts of time such as A.M. and P.M. and learn about elapsed time.
Directions: Introduce the activity to students.  Use different types of clocks as examples.
Tell students that you are going to review some of the basics of how to tell time.  The short hand on the clock indicates the hour while the long hand indicates the minutes.  Not only do the numbers on the face of the clock indicate what hour it is but they also indicate the number of minutes in each hour.  Starting at the 12, you have to count by 5's, going around the clock until you again reach the 12.  Keep in mind that an hour is made up of four quarters.  Each quarter is 15 minutes long.  When the time is 15 minutes past the hour, it can be read as quarter past the hour (Example:  2:15 is also a quarter past 2).  When the time is 15 minutes before the next hour, the time can be read as quarter 'til the hour (Example:  2:45 or quarter 'til 3).
To keep track of the minutes and hours during the day and night, we use several devices.  A wristwatch with a second hand counts oscillations in a little wheel that rocks back and forth.  A grandfather clock counts swings of the pendulum.  A digital watch counts electronic oscillations in a quartz crystal.  All of these are fairly accurate, but they all must be adjusted once in a while.
One of the most accurate clocks is the digital clock which plugs into a wall socket.  Digital clocks count cycles of 60-cycle electrical power.  You might think that the power company is not in the time business, but it is!
Elapsed Time
You can calculate how much time has passed or elapsed from the beginning of an activity to its end.
Sample
Monica and Eli went to the beach.  They left their house at 9:30 a.m.  If they got home at 3:00 p.m., how much time elapsed?
From 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., 21/2 hours elapsed.
From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., 3 hours elapsed.
Add 21/2 hours to 3 hours.  So 51/2 hours elapsed from the time Monica and Eli left their house to when they came back home.
Use the time conversion table below to help you work out the problems on the pages in this unit.




Time Table



            60 seconds = 1 minute


            7 days = 1 week




            60 minutes = 1 hour


            52 weeks = 1 year




            24 hours = 1 day


            10 years = 1 decade




            a.m. is the time from midnight to noon.


            10 decades = 1 century

"Title: Working Backwards Toward Answers
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Data Analysis and Probability, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.), Problem Solving
Objective: Students learn to work backwards in order to solve a problem.
Directions: Facts to Know
To solve some problems, you may need to undo the key actions in the problem.  This strategy is called working backwards.  But before you start these problems, keep in mind that you need to ask yourself these four important questions:

What does the problem ask you to find?
What information is needed to solve the problem? 
How can you show the problem with numbers? 
What is your answer? 


 Sample A
The bakers at Slice o' Pie Restaurant ate 4 pies that were left over from work on Thursday night.  12 pies were sold at the restaurant that night.  The manager took 2 home with her after work.  How many pies were at the restaurant Thursday night?
First, find out the total number of pies sold or taken home.
12 pies sold + 2 pies taken home = 14 pies
Next, add back the 4 pies that the bakers ate.
14 pies sold or taken home + 4 pies eaten by the bakers = 18 pies
Therefore, there were 18 pies at Slice o' Pie Restaurant Thursday night.
 Sample B
Marta likes to borrow books from the library.  She borrowed 18 books over a 3-month period of time (January-March).  If Marta borrowed 8 books in January and 6 books in February, how many books did she borrow in March?
Subtract the number of books Marta borrowed in January and February from the total number of books to determine how many she borrowed in March.
18 books - 8 books - 6 books = 4 books
Marta borrowed 4 books in March.

"Title: A Look at My Teeth
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students will learn about their teeth and make a record of their present teeth.
Directions: Lesson Preparation
Ask your dentist for x-rays of teeth from children and adults.  
Also request teeth specimens, molds, and photographs, as well as booklets on growth and care of the teeth.
Activity
Ask students to feel their teeth with their tongues to see if all of them are exactly alike.  Discuss the differences.  Ask them if they have any missing teeth.  If so, let them feel with their tongues to see if they can feel the new tooth pushing up through the gum.  Discuss what it feels like to lose a tooth.  Tell them that this is a natural part of growing up.
Give each student a mirror and the activity sheet.  Show the transparency of this sheet and use it to show students how to place an X on primary teeth which are missing.  Explain that they should use the toothpick along with the mirror to locate their teeth, counting from the center front to know where these are on the chart.
Let students begin to examine their teeth and record those which are missing.  If any of the students have begun to grow adult teeth (e.g., central incisors), have them circle these on the permanent teeth drawing.  Use the transparency of this chart to show the most frequently missing teeth for the students.  Place an X on those teeth on the transparency.
Show and discuss the transparency Inside a Tooth.  Show the actual teeth specimens.  
Show the teeth x-rays on the overhead projector.  Point out the roots of the teeth which are hidden below the gum line and go deep into the jawbone.  If any primary and adult teeth are on the x-rays, point these out to the students so they realize that the teeth they now have are mostly primary (baby) teeth which will be pushed out as the adult teeth grow into place.
Closure
Have a dentist or dental assistant visit the class to tell them about how their teeth grow and demonstrate how to care for their teeth.

"Title: Baking Ice Cream
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students experiment with properties of frozen food.
Directions: The concept of baking ice cream mystifies students and is a wonderful science activity too!  Follow the directions below (which also appear on the activity sheet) to bake the ice cream.
Heat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius).  Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Beat egg whites only with an electric mixer until they form soft peaks.
Add sugar to the egg whites, 1 tablespoon (45 mL) at a time, beating with the electric mixer until the mixture is thick and glossy.  This is meringue.
Place cookies on the baking sheet.  Cover each cookie with some frozen ice cream.  Make sure the ice cream fits without hanging over the cookies.
Spread meringue thickly all over the ice cream.  Make sure there are no exposed spots of ice cream.
Bake in oven for 2-3 minutes until meringue is lightly brown.
After you have taken the cookies out of the oven, show them to students.  Have them answer the questions on the activity sheet.
When they have finished answering the questions, give them the explanation for why the ice cream did not melt.
The meringue acts as an insulator, just like insulation in a house or coat.  The meringue has small air spaces trapped in it which slow down the passage of heat and cold.  Beating the eggs makes lots of bubbles in the meringue.  When you spread it over ice cream, it insulates so that the heat of the oven cannot get in during the short time it is in the oven.
Tell students that if meringue was permanent and did not melt, you could probably use it to insulate your house.  Imagine living in a meringue house!

"Title: Chromatophores
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science, Art
Objective: Students will learn about a herpetiles' ability to change skin color through an art project.
Directions: Background
A feature of some herpetiles' skin is its ability to change color.  Skin cells called chromatophores contain pigments and are responsible for the color change.  Changes occur from fear, but also from fluctuations in the amount of light present, humidity, and air temperature.  Warmer temperatures cause the chromatophore pigments to contract, which makes the dark-colored pigments harder to see.  Therefore, the herpetile's skin becomes lighter.  With cooler temperatures, the chromatophores usually spread out allowing more of the dark coloring to show.  This causes the skin to appear darker.  A few herpetiles can become a different color altogether.  Two of these species are the Anole and the Chameleon.  To view this amazing chromatophore phenomenon, follow the directions below.

Color Box A's Anole light green and its background dark green.  Color Box B's Anole light brown and its background dark brown.
Cut away Box A and Box B.  (Note: You will now have three sections: A, B, and C.)
Fold Box C on its dashed lines using an accordion-style-folding pattern; crease the fold lines.  Re-open the folds and lay Box C as flat as possible on a desk or tabletop.
Carefully cut apart Box A along the dotted lines.  (Note: Be sure you keep the nine cut strips in their correct sequential order.)  From left to right, glue the green strips onto the Number 1-striped sections of the Box C accordion folds.
Carefully cut apart Box B along the dotted lines.  (Note: Be sure you keep the nine cut strips in their correct sequential order.)  From left to right, glue the brown strips onto the Number 2-striped sections of the Box C accordion folds.
After allowing the glue to dry, re-fold the accordion pleats.  Unfold pleats slightly and place the Box C section in an up-right position.  When viewing the folds from a left-side angle, a green Anole will be seen.  When viewing the folds at eye level from a right-side angle, the Anole's chromatophores will have changed to brown.

"Title: Crocodile Eyes
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students learn about eyes and eyelids that are uniquely characteristics of reptiles and amphibians.
Directions: Introduce to students the fact that many reptiles and amphibians have eyes that are different from those of mammals.  Describe to them the following examples and draw pictures on the board to illustrate.
Most lizards and skinks have round pupils and moveable (closing) eyelids.  The Burrowing skink has a unique clear eyelid window in its lower lid.  When it closes its eyes it can still see through the bottom lid, yet keep out dirt and debris.  Ask students if they can think of reasons why a burrowing skink would need to see out of its lower lid at all times.
Nocturnal geckos have vertical-elliptic pupils, while diurnal (daytime feeding) geckos have round pupils.  Most geckos do not have moveable eyelids.  Their eyes are always open.  A transparent scale called a spectacle protects each eye.  Can students think of ways that having their eyes open all the time helps geckos to survive?
Snakes' pupils are round and vertical-elliptic.  They have no eyelids.  They also have spectacles.  The pupil shape of a snake's eye is not an indication of the presence of poison.
Most frog families have horizontal-elliptic pupils, the exception being the Burrowing and Spadefoot toad families, which have vertical-elliptic pupils.  The bottom eyelids of frogs   move upward and cover the entire pupil area.  Can students think of reasons for this?
Crocodilians have vertical-elliptic pupils with three moveable eyelids per eye: a semi-transparent lid, the upper lid, and the lower lid.  Ask students if they can think of ways that having these types of eyelids helps a crocodilian to find its prey. 
Tell students that they will be completing a simulation to show an example of crocodile eyes.  Distribute copies of the Crocodilian Three-way eyelid activity sheet.  Students should follow the directions to complete a model of a crocodilian eye.

Description: Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students will create interactive slide shows to illustrate the various forms of energy.
Directions: Procedure
Create an interactive slide show about the forms of energy.  This activity lends itself well to cooperative learning groups.  Each group could study a form of energy and become experts.  After the activity is finished, the experts would be available for assistance when the presentation was being used.
Before the Computer

Divide the students into cooperative learning groups.
Assign or have each group choose a form of energy.
The groups will study the forms of energy and plan the slides for their sections of the presentation.
Each group will need to collect pictures to scan, find clip art, draw pictures, and/or take pictures with a digital camera to provide graphic illustrations for the slides.
A teacher-made planning sheet is helpful to guide the children, but encourage them to be creative.
It might be helpful to have some jump-off topics to help with the research:



How does electrical energy affect our lives?
How are electricity and magnetism related?
What are some common devices for heating?
What are some sources for heat energy?
How can heat energy be conserved?
What is noise pollution?
How can sound energy be changed to other forms of energy?
What are some man-made light sources?
How would our lives be different if we had less sunlight?  more sunlight?
What parts of the human body have potential energy?
What is the difference in potential energy and kinetic energy?
Name some kinds of mechanical energy.
What are six kinds of simple machines?
What kinds of energy am I using when I mix the batter for a cake?

"Title: From Liquid to Gas
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students will observe water change into vapor (gas).
Directions: Preparation

Mark the glass container off in 1/2 inch (1 cm) intervals with the permanent marker.
Arrange the classroom so the students will be able to observe this demonstration.  Place the hot plate on the table and arrange seating for the students around the table at a safe distance.
Set the hot plate on its lowest setting and turn it on to preheat it.


Activity

Review what the students observed as they watched their ice cubes melt in the previous activity.  Ask them to tell you why their ice melted.  (The ice melted because it was too warm.)  Ask them what they think will happen if you pour the water from their melted ice cubes into the glass container and then set it on the hot plate.
Give each student a cup of water and let him or her pour it into the glass container.  Add a drop of dark food coloring to make the water visible.  Have the students notice where the water level is on the container.  Use the marker and place the #1 next to the marker at the top of the water level.  Number the other marks to the bottom of the container beginning with #2, etc.
Put the thermometer into the water and have the students look at the level of the liquid in the thermometer.  Write the temperature on the board.  Continue to write the temperature on the board as the water heats up and begins to boil.
Place the container on the hot plate and turn up the heat.  Have the students observe what is happening.  Leave the thermometer in the water.  As they observe, ask them questions such as those below.
    
What do you see in the water? (Bubbles will begin to form as it gets hotter.)
Is the water getting warmer?  How do you know? (The thermometer liquid is rising.)
Do you see anything in the container other than water? (Steam will begin to appear.)


As the water begins to boil, point out that the bubbles are bigger and that the water is in motion.  Show the steam rising from the water.  Have students note the water level.  Ask them where they think the steam is coming from and where it is going.  (The steam is coming from the water, and it is going into the air.)
Continue to record the temperature of the water (it should level off once it begins to boil), and point out the level of the water as it drops.  Stop the demonstration before the container boils dry.  Remove the container from the hot plate and place it on a pot holder on the table.

Closure

Ask the students what they think will happen to the rest of the water in the container.  (It will evaporate, turn to gas, and become part of the atmosphere.)
Discuss what they observed, being sure they understand that the water turned to gas when it was heated.
Distribute the What Happened to the Water? Data Sheet for students to complete.  Permit them to discuss this with other students as they work on the data sheet.

Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students will plant a small garden of birdseed on a sponge.
Directions: Lesson Preparation
Label the pie pans with a number which is assigned to each group of students.  Hot-glue one sponge to each pie pan to keep it in place.  Add enough water to soak the sponge and leave a thin covering of water on the bottom of the pan.
Activity

Have students get into their groups.  Distribute a magnifier to each student and a sample of birdseed.  Let them examine the birdseed and describe what they see.  Tell them that these seeds are too small to open up to see if each has a baby plant inside it.  Ask them to think of a way to find out if there is a baby plant inside.  Tell them that one way is to plant them in a small garden where they can be observed.
Provide each group with a pie pan, sponge, and about a tablespoon of birdseed.  Let the students sprinkle their birdseed over the top of the sponge.  Tell them they have just planted a small garden.  Explain that these will be collected and placed on a table but will be returned to each group daily during the time they measure their lima bean and pinto bean plants.  Explain that they will keep a daily record of changes they see in their gardens.
Distribute a copy of page 16 to each student to begin the recording of the sponge garden.

Closure
Record the growth of the seeds.
Discuss what the students have learned thus far.

Extender
Soak an avocado seed to soften it and split it open so the students can see the small seedling inside. Grow an avocado seed for students to observe.  It takes several months for the seedling to appear.  Use a one-pint (.5 L) water bottle cut to half its height.  Push two toothpicks or T-pins into opposite sides of the seed about halfway between the ends.  Cut two slits on opposite sides of the bottle and put the toothpicks in the slits.  The seed should be suspended so the stem end is below water level.  Replace the water as it evaporates.

"Title: Snakes: Illusions in Locomotion
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students learn about the ways that snakes move.
Directions: Tell students that snakes have four main methods of locomotion:
Big-bodied snakes, such as pythons, boas, and vipers, use a rectilinear motion.  They press their large scales against the ground creating traction and moving their bodies in a straightforward motion.
Sidewinder snakes, such as the Namib Adder, literally lift portions of their bodies off the ground and thrust forward in a sideways motion.  This form of movement keeps these snakes from falling down soft sand dunes and dusty trails.
Snakes that move with a concertina motion literally bunch themselves up and thrust themselves forward by quickly straightening their bodies.
Slender snakes, such as Rat snakes and Racers, move quickly by using a curving serpentine motion.  This is accomplished when the sides of their bodies push against surface irregularities moving them forward.  
After introducing these methods, have students visually create the serpentine movement by following these directions:
Directions

Using the scissors, cut apart the two Locomotion Illusion sections; discard the cut-away paper.
Glue the straight-stripe section onto a piece of same-size cardstock; trim edges.
Choose two to three colors to decorate the white stripes.  (Note: The illusion works best when there is a pattern to the colors.) 
Cut a 1"" x 7"" (2.54 cm x 18 cm) pull-tab strip from the remaining cardstock.  Tape the 1"" 
(2.54 cm) pull-tab to the center back area of the striped section.  (Note: The pull-tab should extend beyond one of the two shorter sides of the striped section.)
Using the sharp knife or razor blade (ask an adult to do this), cut out the white, curvy lines on the black section.  (Be certain no white color remains after the lines have been cut out.)
Using the scissors, cut out a rectangle from the black construction paper that matches the curvy-lined box.  Place the colored-stripe, tabbed section on top of the cut-out black construction paper rectangle.
Place the curvy-lined box on top of the placed striped section.  Using the transparent tape, tape the top and side edges together.
Gently pull the tab downward to view the serpentine locomotion illusion.

"Title: Investigating Fingerprints
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students learn that each individual possesses a unique set of fingerprints.
Directions: Use one of the following methods to make fingerprints.  The first method will be less messy and if done carefully will yield an excellent print.

Rub a soft lead pencil on paper until you produce a good pencil smudge.  Rub your finger in the smudge and lift the print off your finger with clear tape.
Roll your finger on a stamp pad and roll, not press, the finger on white paper to make an impression.

Without letting students look, ask them what they would see if they looked very closely at their fingers.  Distribute magnifying glasses and ask students to make observations about their fingers.  Focus attention on the tips of the fingers and encourage students to look at their fingerprint patterns.
Distribute copies of the activity sheet and ask students to record the fingerprints of both hands on the sheet using one of the methods described above.  Model how to make a fingerprint impression.  Then have students make their own fingerprints.  After their prints are done, ask students to describe the patterns of the fingerprints.  Introduce the loop, whorl, and arch patterns at the bottom of the activity page and have students identify which patterns closely resemble those made by their fingerprints.

If time permits, pick out a set of prints made by somebody in the class and ask a team of ""detectives"" with magnifying glasses to identify whose they are.

"Title: Phases of the Moon Flip Book
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will make a flipbook of the moon to see how the phases change.
Directions: Lesson Preparation
Make enough copies of the flipbook pages for each student.  Cut these into sets.
Make up a set of moon phase pictures and file cards for each student.  Glue the #1 picture on the file card of each set as a model for the students.  This should be placed in the lower left corner as shown.
Activity

Review the moon phases and how they occur.  Tell the students that they are going to make a flipbook which will be like a movie of the moon's motion around Earth.
Distribute 16 file cards to each student.  Show them the model of the first card so they will know where to glue the rest of the pictures on each card.
After all pictures have been glued on cards, help students lay these in a pile in numerical order, beginning with card #16.
Arrange each set of cards so the lowest edges are slightly offset about 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the card underneath.  (See drawing on page 17.)  This will enable the thumb to flip rapidly through the cards when they are stacked.
Hold the card stack in place with a rubber band and flip through them to see if the sun can be seen clearly at the top of the cards and the moons appear to move around Earth.
Remove the rubber band and place a long strip of clear packing tape along the back of the cards and overlap the front card for about 1 inch (2.5 cm).  This will anchor the cards in place.  Run a second strip vertically around the top of the cards.  Be sure to avoid locking the cards in place so they will not flip easily.  If this happens, use scissors to slide through the tape at the sides until the cards move freely.

Closure
Demonstrate to the students how to hold their books at the top in one hand and use their thumbs to flip the pages rapidly, creating the motion-picture effect.  Have them do this several times and then discuss the position of sun, moon, and Earth with them as they flip the pages.  They should see the moon moving around Earth.  Now, have them look only at the moon phases in the lower corner of the cards as they flip the pages.  The phases should rapidly change from new through all the phases and return to the new position.
Relate this motion of the cards to what they have seen in the sky as well as when they used their moon balls in the bright light.

Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students learn about Sir Issac Newton's theory that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Directions: Teacher Directions: Space rockets need to use a great deal of force to be propelled into outer space.  What is it that causes the forward motion of a rocket?  The following physical science activity will illustrate for your students Sir Isaac Newton's theory that ""for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.""  In this case the ""action"" of the gases escaping the balloon will cause the ""reaction"" of the rocket moving forward.
Student Procedure:

Feed the string through the straw.
Determine a flight pattern for the rocket.  There are a variety of options, all of which can be employed for comparative purposes.  Here are some suggestions:
    
Two students hold the ends of the string in a level fashion. 
Attach one end of the string to the wall with tape or a pushpin.  (Be sure the string is level with the student.) 
Attach one end of the string to the ceiling. 
Attach each end of the string to the back of a chair.  (This option has been illustrated for you on the activity page.) 


Attach three pieces of tape to the straw.  Inflate the balloon, but just pinch it off instead of tying it.  While pinching the balloon, attach it to the straw and tape.  (See the diagram on the activity page.) 
Make predictions about the distance the balloon will travel.  Discuss whether the direction (up or across) will make any variation.  Record predictions. 
At the starting signal, instruct the students to release the balloons and watch them fly across (or up) the strings.  (See the diagram on the activity page.) 

You may wish to extend this activity by having your students add additional balloons (increased thrust) and weight (increased load) to the experiment and observe the results.  Also, try balloons of different shapes and sizes and observe and record any variations in speed and distance.
Finally, ask your students to summarize the phenomenon of force that was used in this experiment.  Students should complete the data capture sheet in order to help them reconstruct and explain the experiment.  Through group discussions, encourage your students to come up with some universal principles that were used.

"Title: Splendid Spores
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students conduct an experiment to learn about fungi.
Directions: Fundamental Facts
Black bread mold has a fuzzy, spider-web appearance.  It is a type of parasitic fungi that lives on non-living organic matter.  It begins as a microscopic, airborne spore that germinates on contact with any moist surface of nonliving organic matter.  It spreads quickly, forming a fine network of filament clusters that obtain food by absorbing it directly from the organic matter it has attached itself to.  When the sporangia (knob-like spore cases) ripen, they break open, and the spores float in the wind until they land and begin the reproduction cycle again.  Fungi and bacteria can be found anywhere other life exists.  They work together to decay and decompose all organic matter.
Procedure
Prepare a bulletin board (away from bright light) to display the plastic bags.  It should be located in a place that is easily accessible for student observations.  If you do not have a board that is out of the direct light, staple a large piece of poster paper to the top of the board and let it hang loosely over the bags.  The paper can be lifted for observations.
Find an open area outside, preferably out of the reach of animals, and roll out the foil.  Give each student a slice of bread.  Have the students place their bread slices on the foil and sprinkle them with a few drops of water.  Leave the bread out overnight.  The next day, have the students put each slice of bread in a plastic bag (be sure to label the bags with their names).  Tightly seal the bags and staple them to the bulletin board.  Make sure the students' names show.  Provide magnifying glasses for observations and the journal records for writing about their observations.
Ask the students to hypothesize about the following questions:

Why was the bread dampened?
Why was the bread left outside overnight?
Why was the bread put into plastic bags?
Why was the bread placed in a darkened area?
What will happen to the bread?


Have the students complete the sequencing activity.  Allow them to use magnifying glasses to observe the black mold growth.  At the specific intervals suggested on the journal record, have them record their observations.

Contact parents and the school health clerk or nurse to find crutches and wheelchairs which may be used for this activity.  Sleep masks and earplugs are usually available in drug stores.
Procedure
Ask the students if they have ever had to use crutches or a wheelchair.  Have them share what this was/is like and the problems they may have had.  Explain to the students that inventions are often created to help people who are physically challenged.  Discuss how these have helped them.
Tell the students that they are going to be teamed with a partner and that each pair of students will be given a temporary physical challenge.  Let them know that each member of the team will spend time experiencing the challenge.  Explain that the purpose of this activity is for them to design an invention that will make life easier if they have to live with this challenge forever.  They will not actually make the invention but draw it instead.
Divide the students into pairs and let each team choose its physical challenge card from a bag.  Have them read the information on the card and discuss what the rules will be during this time.
Complete the challenge.
Closure
Distribute drawing paper to the students and have them design their inventions.  They should label them and explain how they will be used.
Have each team post its design on the bulletin board and explain it to the class.
Compare the inventions that were made for the same type of physical challenge.

"Title: What Goes Around Comes Around
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will learn about the part the ocean plays in the hydrologic or water cycle.
Directions: Setting the Stage
Go outside and find a puddle.  Mark around its edges with chalk or rocks.  Observe the water over the next two days.  How long does it take for the water to evaporate?  What effect does sunshine or shade have on the process?
Procedure

Evaporation--how water gets into the air to form clouds
    
With the wet sponge or wet towel, draw a large O for ocean on the chalkboard.  Watch as it disappears.  Where did it go?
Repeat the procedure.  This time try to make the O on the chalkboard disappear faster.  See what effect fanning it with a towel (to represent wind) or heating it with a lamp (to imitate the sun's heat) might make.
Record your observations on the data-capture sheet.


Condensation--how water changes form a vapor to a liquid
    
About 30 minutes before this exercise, put the lid in the freezer.
Place the dish on the hot plate and turn the setting on high.
When the dish is warm, leave it on the hot plate, but turn off the heat.
Take the lid from the freezer and put it on the dish.  Observe what happens next.
Record your observations on the data-capture sheet.



Extension
Complete the story of the hydrologic cycle.  After water has evaporated from the ocean, clouds form.  As the droplets become heavier and cool down, they fall to the earth as rain.  This water collects in rivers which flow back into the ocean..
Closure
In their ocean journals, have the students write a story about the journey of a water drop as it goes through the water cycle.

"Title: What Holds a Substance Together?
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students observe how substances are held together by bonds.
Directions: Tell students that chemicals are substances held together by bonds.  Some bonds are stronger than others.  Two types of bonds are covalent bonds (bonds formed by the sharing of electrons) and ionic bonds (bonds formed by the attraction of oppositely charged ions).  This activity provides students with the experience of observing and stretching bonds.  They will actually see how substances are held together.
Student Directions:

  Hold the sheet of newspaper so that it looks as if you are holding a rectangle.  With your hands, pull (in opposite directions) both ends of the paper.  Note what happens.
 Rip the sheet of newspaper in half.  Note how easily it rips and the shape formed on each piece of paper after it is ripped.
 Repeat steps 1 and 2 with each type of paper.
 Carefully and slowly stretch a marshmallow to the point where it is ready to separate into two pieces.
 Using the standard (metric) ruler, measure to the nearest inch (centimeter) the farthest distance that the bonds in the marshmallows stretched.  Record your observation.
 Repeat steps 4 and 5 with a piece of gummy candy and with a piece of candy containing chewy caramel.
 Complete your data-capture sheet.

"Title: What Will Rust?
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students will experiment with various types of metals to discover those which rust.
Directions: Send home the parent letter requesting a variety of metals for this activity.
Begin this activity on a Monday since the experiment needs at least a week to yield results.
Activity

Ask the students if they have ever seen something which has rusted.  Tell them that they are going to experiment with a variety of objects to see what will rust and what will not rust.
Distribute the parent letter and discuss the types of items students may bring for this experiment.
When students have brought their items to school, distribute a data sheet to each of them.
Tell the students to put their objects into the cup (jar) and then add just enough water to cover the bottom of the container.  If students did not bring steel wool, prepare a jar to test it and assign a student to keep a record of it.
Show them how to complete the information on their data sheets, including the day, date, and time for their first drawing.  Be sure they are recording as many details as possible.
Have students add to their records daily.  You may want to make a video record of the changes daily so students can discuss the changes that occurred after the experiment is over.

Closure

After at least five days, have the students sort the items into two groups, those which rusted and those which did not.  List this information on the board.  If a video record was made of the items, show it to the class.  Ask students to see if they can find anything which those that rusted have in common.  (They should discover that these are all metal but that not all items rusted.)
Have students test the items that rusted with a magnet to see if it will pick them up.  (They will be attracted to a magnet since the metals that rusted have iron in them.)
After the students test the metals that rusted with their magnets, tell them the metal is iron.
Tell students to look for signs of rusting metal at school and home and have them share their discoveries with the rest of the class.

Resources: 
, assorted small metal items (include steel wool), 
, clear plastic cups or baby food jars, 
, water, 
, parent letter (page 38),

"Title: Where Does Food Go?
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students will take a walk through the digestive system to see how food passes through the body.
Directions: Lesson Preparation
Pin the bedsheet to a wall and project the transparency of The Digestive System.  Trace the picture with pencil and then lay the sheet on a table.  Trace over drawing and labels with colored felt pens.
Cut a length of string eight yards (7.2 meters) long.  Measure two yards (1.8 meters) of thick yarn.  Use tape to label it the ""Large Intestine.""  Tape the yarn to the string and measure seven yards (6.3 meters) from where they join.  This part is to be labeled ""Small Intestine.""  The remaining string is the distance from the mouth through the stomach and into the small intestine.
Activity

Conduct this lesson following lunch.  Give each child unlined paper to draw where they think their lunch goes after it is swallowed.  Have them begin their drawings at the mouth and show its journey to the point where it leaves the body.  (Do not give any information since this is a pretest.)
Tell students they will journey through the digestive system to follow food through the body.  Lay the bedsheet on the floor to see the parts of the digestive system.  Ask for a volunteer to walk through the body as you read the script.  The underlined terms in the script are the labels found on the drawing.  Point these out as the student moves through the digestive system.
Ask students how long they think the entire digestive system is from mouth to anus in an adult.  Say you are going to walk from the front of the room and they are to hold up a hand when they think you have gone as far as the digestive system would stretch.  Begin moving slowly and stop when most hands are up.
Let a volunteer hold the ""mouth"" end of the string and begin to stretch it out.  Stop to show the distance to the stomach and then the small intestine.  Let students update predictions on the length of the digestive system by having a volunteer stand at the point they think you will reach when all string is unwound.  Unwind the string and show students the full length of the system.  Explain that this is what would be found inside a six-foot person; their digestive systems would be shorter since they are smaller.
Have them look at the small and large intestine and explain how they got their names.  (The small intestine is longer but thinner than the large intestine.)

Closure
Distribute students' original drawings of the digestive system and let them draw another.
Resources: 
, twin-size white bedsheet, 
, transparency of The Digestive System  (see link below), 
, copy of Food Travelogue (see link below), 
, various colored permanent pens, 
, measuring tape, 
, string and thick yarn,

"Title: Enchanted Enhancements
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Grammar
Objective: Students learn how to use adjectives and descriptive phrases to complement and enhance their writing.
Directions: Tell students that when they are writing, sometimes a simple, complete sentence is all that is needed.  However, at other times it is a good idea to give more details.
Give them this example: Lorna saw a dog.  When you read this sentence, you probably imagine some kind of dog.  If all of your classmates drew pictures of the dog, each one would be very different.
Lorna saw a monstrous, hairy dog, with legs that were three-feet long, and it drooled as it trotted directly toward her!  When you read this sentence, you have a much better idea of what the dog looked like.  Descriptive language and additional information about the subject is very useful and makes the sentence more interesting.
A word that helps describe something is an adjective.  There are three types of adjectives.

Demonstrative Adjectives: These point out.  They answer the question, Which one(s)?  Examples: this, that, these, those - I like this dress.  Those cookies look delicious.
Common Adjectives: These describe the subject in a general way.  They answer the question, What kind of? or How many?  Examples: soft, warm, six, blue, sunny, tired, tall.  The building is tall.  The kitten is soft.
Proper Adjectives: These are made from proper nouns and are always capitalized.  They answer the question, What kind of?  Examples: Irish, Martian, African American, Native American, Elizabethan - I love French cheese!  There are many Japanese cars.


Go over the following sentences with students.  Ask them to identify the adjectives in the sentences.  Then have them identify the questions that the adjectives answer. (What kind of?  How many?  Which one?)
1.I don't like this sandwich.
2.The old man came to the door.
3.Most French students speak English.
4.We're learning a Scottish dance tomorrow.
5.The yellow flowers are wilting.
6.I have three brothers.
7.For dinner tonight, they're serving a delicious spinach casserole.
8.Give me your dollar, and I'll give you my comic book.
9.Tim doesn't want that soft pear.
10.Watch out for the mean dog down the street.
11.My clueless brother threw away my homework.
12.Those black shoes are too small.

"Title: Figuratively Speaking
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Traits of Writing, Oral Language
Objective: Students will learn about and create examples of figurative language.
Directions: Students will take to writing figuratively like flies to honey when they practice this element of writing while including some vivid illustrations.  Share some figurative language from the phrases listed below, or, if possible, distribute copies of Mad As a Wet Hen! to each student.  (Other good resource books include ones written by Fred Gwynne.  See the Materials list.)  Introduce the use of figurative language by sharing some phrases either from the book or by introducing the phrases below and helping students identify situations in which they might be used.  Then share the illustrations on the following page with the class and have them identify the familiar phrases that accompany them.  If they can't guess by using the picture, help them by sharing the accompanying sentences.  If they still can't guess, give them the answer.  
Next, have students either select a phrase from the book or one of their own favorites for which to create a three-part study card.  Give each student a sheet of drawing paper measuring 4"" x 12"".  They fold the paper to make three boxes, each 4"" x 4"" in size.  Then they write the figurative phrase in the first box, a picture illustrating the literal meaning in the second box, and the phrase's meaning in the third box.  Have each person in turn fold back the two worded ends so that only the picture is showing.  Then he shares the center of his card as the class tries to guess the figurative phrase.  Once this is disclosed, he shares what the phrase really means.  You may wish to challenge the class to use the phrase in a sentence.  Post the students' work on a bulletin board entitled ""Figuratively Speaking.""
For more practice using figurative language in their writing, have students complete the Figuratively Speaking activity sheet and select one of the sentences for which to write a story.  They should include a literal picture to demonstrate the use of the figurative language they selected.
Sample Figurative Language Phrases

Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Kill two birds with one stone.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
The early bird gets the worm.

"Title: Finding Main Ideas
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension
Objective: Students read newspaper articles to determine the main idea of a story.
Directions: Finding Main Ideas
Writers Communicate with Readers
Writing is a form of communication.  Writers, in other words, have something to say to readers.  What the writer is talking about, the main point of what the writer is saying, is the main idea.
Without a main idea, nothing very much is said--nothing of importance, anyway.  Think of someone chattering endlessly without really telling you anything.  ""Get to the point!"" you say.  Or, ""What in the world are you talking about?""  What you are asking for in such cases is the main idea of the conversation.  If there is no main idea there is no real conversation.  It is all small talk.
In good writing you shouldn't have to search for the main idea.  A good writer makes the ideas jump out at you.  Everything either points to the main ideas, leads up to them, or explains them. 

Previews and Main Ideas
One reason that previewing is so useful is that it helps you find main ideas in your reading before you start to read.  A headline and sub-headings often tell at a glance what the main ideas are.  It isn't always that easy, but previewing  will certainly provide clues to main ideas so that you know them when you see them.

Main Ideas and Details
Some people have trouble deciding what is a main idea in a piece of reading and what is a detail about a main idea.  This should not be a big problem. Decide which sentence is the most important statement in a paragraph or in a group of paragraphs.  What is the writer talking about?
Details explain a main idea.  Details may be in the form of facts, explanations or descriptions.  What is the following short article about?  And what are some of the details?

It was a great day for the Clemson Tigers when they became college football's national champions.  The big win came in Clemson's victory over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.  This was the school's first national championship in 86 years of gridiron play.

This first sentence tells what the article is about.  The main reason for the article is to tell you about Clemson's big win.  So this is the main idea.  Where they won--the Orange Bowl, and what team they beat--Nebraska, are details.  The fact that this was their first championship in 86 years is also a detail.
Find the main idea in this paragraph.

The town of Concord is where they fired the shot ""heard 'round the world.""  But the people of Concord have become fed up with guns, handguns at least.  Concord has joined five other towns in an effort to ban ownership of pistols by private citizens.

This time the  main idea is not the first sentence.  The first sentence points to the main idea.  It starts you thinking about guns, which is the main point of the article.  Concord is fed up with guns.  That is the main idea and it appears in the second sentence which is also the topic sentence of the paragraph.
The last sentence tells what Concord is doing about handguns, so this is a detail.

 Putting Many Ideas Together
There is almost always more than one important idea in any reading material longer than a paragraph or two.  Long news articles and chapters of books are packed full of ideas.  But you can still point to one thing, the most important thing, that is the main subject of the whole article.
What you want to do with long articles, or chapters of a book, is organize the ideas in your mind.  Here is how it is done:

Keep the main subject of the reading in mind.  You may have found this in your previewing.  Write it down if you have to.  Hang on to it.
Watch for the most important idea in each long paragraph or group of short paragraphs.  (You can find these in topic sentences.)
Work with one long paragraph at a time or a few short ones.  Do not do too much at once or you may get lost in a tangle of ideas and details.
Think how each idea you find ties into the main subject (main idea) of the whole article.
If you are doing study reading where you must remember important ideas for a test later on, make an outline from the main ideas you find.  (Once again, use the topic sentences.)

"Title: Free Verse
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Traits of Writing
Objective: Students learn about writing poetry and write their own free verse poems.
Directions: Discuss with students how to write a poem.  Introduce the following three-step method.  
1.Choose a Subject 
Just about any subject or idea will work.  As you read more poetry, you will discover that poems have been written on just about every topic imaginable.  It's a good idea to choose a subject that is familiar to you.  Good subjects might be your pet, a family member, how you felt about an experience or event, a dream you had, or even what you see from the window of your room.  
Here are a few ideas to get your imagination in gear:
Think about a subject that is very important to you.  Maybe it's baseball, clean air, world peace, or new shoes.  If it's important to you, it will make a good poem because you will put energy and feeling into it.  Think of some subjects that are often overlooked, such as a far corner of the garage, an old toy, or even your elbow.  Things we don't pay much attention to often make good poem subjects.
Think of an event in your life and write your feelings about it.  It could be a death in the family, a broken arm, a flight on an airplane, or visiting a faraway relative.  Remember your senses when you think of topics for poems.  You could write a poem about the sound of a dripping faucet at night, the smell of your dog coming in from the rain, or the sight of the sky after a storm.
2.Prepare to Write  
You may want to let your idea ""incubate.""  Incubation is a word many writers use for prewriting.  During this time, think about your topic, add to it and think of other things that are related to your topic and what it is that you want to say about it.  Ask yourself ""what if..."" questions such as ""What if my elbow got stuck?"", or ""What if I had three elbows on each arm?"", or ""What if my old teddy bear started to talk?  Would he tell me about everything I did as a baby?""
3.Write the Poem  
Once you have lots of ideas and notes, it's time to get your poem on paper.  Some poets write their poems just once and never change them.  This doesn't always happen, though, and when it does, the poet has probably spent a lot of time thinking about the poem ahead of time.  Usually poems are written just like anything else that is written.  There are scratch-outs, mess-ups, and changes made until it is finished.  Polish it as much as you can, avoiding imitation of another poet or person.  Some of the best things about poetry are that it is imperfect and individual.  You can structure your poem any way you want.  It can have stanzas, rhyme, or it can be free verse.  It's up to you.  But don't be surprised if your poem takes shape as you are writing it.
Introduce the idea of free verse poetry to students.  Distribute the Free Verse activity sheet and discuss the example poem on the page.  Then have students work independently to write their own free verse poems.

"Title: Mood
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Journaling, Traits of Writing
Objective: Students write paragraphs in which they identify how the subject of a story or song influenced their feelings and thoughts.
Directions: 

Show the students a series of drawn faces that each have a different expression that reveals an emotion.  As you show them the faces, discuss with them the expressions.  Use the following question to guide your discussion:  ""Does this person feel sad, happy, outraged, supportive, excited, or amazed?""
Inform the students that mood is the feeling that the audience has after reading the work of a particular author, listening to a song, or watching a movie. 
Have students read a story or listen to a song.  (Choose a song that has a narrative.)  When you have finished reading the story or listening to the song, lead a discussion about how the subject influenced the students' feelings and thoughts.  Use the following question to guide your discussion: ""Did you feel [sad, happy, outraged, supportive, excited, amazed, scared, or another emotion] as a result of reading the story or listening to the song?""  Have students choose specific words, phrases, or sentences from the story or song that helped to influence their feelings.  Use the activity sheet entitled ""Identifying Mood"" to guide your discussion.
Divide the students into pairs and have them read aloud the rough drafts of their reviews and identify the mood (if any) that they feel as a result of listening to their partner's drafts.
Instruct students to each write a paragraph about the story they read or the song to which they listened.  After writing, students should highlight words or phrases that reveal their feelings and thoughts about the subject.
Divide students into pairs and have them read each other's paragraphs.  Instruct partners to identify specific words and phrases in the paragraph that reveal the writer's feelings and thoughts about the subject.

Portfolio Piece:  Have students include their paragraphs in their portfolios and each write a reflection on the importance of connecting with the thoughts and feelings of the audience. 
Publishing:  Have students write original survival stories.  Then have them share their survival stories in groups of four or five and identify the moods of the listeners as the authors share their stories.  (Possible feelings:  fear, concern, anxiety, frustration, etc.)
Technology Connection:  Create a bulletin board of reviews and categorize the reviews according to the feelings of the writers about the subjects being reviewed.
Home-School Connection:  Have students look through magazines with a family member and focus on their moods when viewing the advertisements.

"Title: Writing About Time: My Favorite Times
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students will write a three-paragraph essay about their favorite times.
Directions: Instructions
The following directions are broken down into parts to help students write a larger essay.  The main purpose is helping students to practice putting paragraphs together.  Plan to teach the following steps over the course of several days.  The number of days needed depends upon your students' ability, attention span, etc.
Illustrating Directions

Brainstorm with students their favorite days of the week and favorite times of the day.  Discuss the difference between a.m. and p.m.  Explain that a.m. is from 12:00 midnight until 11:59 in the morning while p.m. is from 12:00 noon until 11:59 in the evening.  Demonstrate the change of a.m. and p.m. on a manipulative clock.  If enough manipulative clocks are available, students may also manipulate their own clocks as they work in groups.
Instruct students to fill in their favorite day and time in the a.m. and their favorite time in the p.m. on Worksheet #1. Students can write their favorite time in the a.m. on one clock and their favorite time of the p.m. on the other clock.
Direct students to create an illustration of their favorite times by drawing a picture on their favorite day of the week.  Next to each hour of the clock, they can draw a symbol representing what they are doing at that time of the day.  For example, they can draw a bed at 1:00 a.m. and a plate of eggs and toast at 7:00 a.m.  When students are finished, they will have a 24-hour pictorial time line.  (The same symbol may be used for different times.)
Writing a Three-Paragraph Essay

First Paragraph

Distribute copies of Worksheet #2 to guide students.  Explain to students that they will be writing about their favorite times in three different paragraphs to create one essay.  They can record their rough drafts on the worksheet.  The first paragraph will be about their favorite day of the week.
The topic sentence for this paragraph will state each student's favorite day; however, once the essay is completed, students will add a final, main topic sentence to the beginning of this paragraph. In other words, the first paragraph will probably have six sentences.  An example of the first paragraph topic sentence is as follows:
My favorite day of the week is Saturday.
(Note:  An example of a main topic sentence that ties together all three paragraphs is given in Steps #9 and 10.)

Second Paragraph

Students then write three supporting sentences giving reasons why they have chosen their preferred day.  For example:
I like Saturday because I do not have piano lessons.  Saturday T.V. also shows many cartoons.  I can play all day because I do not have to go to school 
The students' concluding sentence for the paragraph might be the following:
Saturday is the best day of the week.
Remind students about the difference between a.m. and p.m.  Explain that a.m. is from 12:00 midnight until 11:59 in the morning, and p.m. is from 12:00 noon until 11:59 in the evening.
Direct students to choose their favorite time of the morning and to write a paragraph using the same format as the first paragraph.  For example:
My favorite hour in the a.m. is 10:00.  Sometimes on Saturday, I watch television.  When I am at school, I go to recess.  On Sundays, I go to church.  In the morning, 10:00 a.m. is a relaxing time of day for me.

Third Paragraph

Explain to students that they will be writing about their favorite hour in the p.m. hours.
Direct students to use the same format as the first and second paragraphs to write their third paragraphs.  For example:
My favorite p.m. hour is 6:00 p.m.  I like this time because my dad comes home from work.  I also get to play a little longer.  Then, I get to eat dinner.  In the evening, 6:00 p.m. is a fun time of day.

Main Topic Sentence and Concluding Sentence

Explain to students that they need to create one major sentence to begin their essays.  This is the main topic sentence that will begin the first paragraph and also will tell what the essay is about.  They are to write this sentence at the top of Worksheet #2 where it reads ""Main topic sentence of the essay.""
Guide students to read over their three paragraphs in order to create sentences that introduce their entire essays.  For example:
I have many different favorite times.
Point out that they can not use ""My favorite day is . . ."" as a topic sentence because that only talks about one of the paragraphs.
Explain to students that they now need to create one big concluding sentence---the final sentence of the third paragraph---that finishes the essay.  For example:
In closing, I enjoy each of these times very much.
When students have completed their worksheets, students proofread the page for any errors they may have made and correct them.
Edit each student's paragraph, or have students peer edit each other's work.
Once the editing step has been completed, instruct students to rewrite their essays on lined white paper with the proper heading (name, date, and subject) and a title.  Also, remind them to indent each new paragraph.

Variations
Emerging Writers
Write a single paragraph about one favorite time of the day.
Experienced Writers
Write a three-paragraph essay independently, without a worksheet for guidance.  Include transitions, and develop complex sentences.
Evaluation
The instructor will be able to check the following:

Is there a main topic sentence and a main concluding sentence?
Are there three complete paragraphs in the correct format?
Does the student provide supporting reasons for each favorite time?
Are the grammar, punctuation and spelling correct?
Can the student tell the difference between a.m. and p.m.?

"Title: Paragraph Matching
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension
Objective: Students match topic sentence cards to their correct body sentences cards.
Directions: Discuss with students the essential parts of a paragraph.
The Beginning
The first sentence of a paragraph is the topic sentence.  It tells what the paragraph will be about.  Topic sentences need a specific subject and a specific feeling or attitude.  For instance: 
""My brother must be from another planet."" 
My brother is the subject; must be from another planet is the feeling or attitude. 
The Middle
The sentences that follow the topic sentence add specific details to tell more about the topic.  The details need to make the topic more interesting or help explain what you mean.  Every sentence in the middle of the paragraph, or the body, needs to be about the topic stated in the topic sentence.  The sentences in the middle are also known as the body sentences or the supporting sentences.  Here are three body sentences for the topic sentence above:  
First of all, he doesn't sit down and chew food like us earthlings; he inhales his food as he passes by the table, and then he disappears.  He has also been known to emit some very peculiar odors which he seems to like to collect and keep in the form of sweatsocks and dirty T-shirts which he tucks into corners of his room and under the bed.  If that is not enough, he makes very odd sounds that seem to be a kind of screeching language from his native planet, ""EEeeeeeecccchhhhsssss,  belllpppppp, gggggrrrrrroggggggghhhhh.""
The End
The last sentence of your paragraph is the concluding sentence or closing.  This sentence reminds the reader of what the topic is about and what it means.  
This could be a closing sentence for the paragraph above:  
And so, it is clear that my brother is not an earthling at all.  I wonder if my parents have figured this out?
Here is a paragraph that has a topic sentence, two body sentences, and a closing sentence.
School is fun.  In school we learn about many interesting subjects.  We read and write and play with our friends.  I can't wait to go to school each morning.
Tell students that it is their turn to think of body sentences to support the topic sentence.  Write the following examples on the board and have students fill in the blanks:
School is fun.
1. ______________________________________________________
2. ______________________________________________________
I can't wait to go to school each morning.
Extension:  Instead of just two body sentences, have students think of three or four.  Write a paragraph that begins with: ""School is no fun at all,"" or ""My brother (sister/friend/pet) must be from another planet.""
Distribute the activity sheets and have students play the matching game to demonstrate their knowledge of paragraphs.

"Title: Prepositional Phrases
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Grammar
Objective: Students will learn about prepositional phrases and practice working with them.
Directions: Introduction
A phrase is a group of words without a subject and predicate.  It functions as a single part of speech. A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition, a noun or pronoun that is its object, and any modifiers of the noun or pronoun.
Examples:  Jon ate  at home.  Jon ate at the luxurious convalescent home.
Prepositional phrases function as adjectives (to modify nouns and pronouns) and as adverbs (to modify verbs, adjectives, and adverbs).
Adjectival prepositional phrases tell us more about or describe a noun or pronoun. They should be placed close to the noun or pronoun they modify.  Example:  The girl with long hair is coming to the party.
Adverbial prepositional phrases do the work of an adverb. They tell us more about verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. They tell how, when, or where an action occurs.
Examples:  The boy kicked the ball with a lot of skill. (modifies verb kicked);  Sally was rich as a queen. (modifies adjective rich);  I run early in the morning. (modifies adverb early)
Teaching Strategies
Add a preposition
Have children add a suitable preposition to begin a phrase.
The cow jumped _________ the moon.
Classroom phrases
Have children indicate the positions of certain objects in the classroom. Tell them that they must answer with a prepositional phrase.
Teacher:  Tom, where is the television?
Tom:  near the table
Circle the phrases
As children become more confident, have them search through sentences you have prepared, or through a photocopy of a familiar story, to find and circle the prepositional phrases.
Suggest a phrase 
Have children suggest prepositional phrases used as adjectives (to describe nouns or pronouns) or adverbs (to describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs) to complete sentences.
The bell rings at nine o'clock. (adverbial phrase modifies the verb rings );  I saw the girl with red hair. (adjectival phrase modifies the noun girl )
Complete the sentence
Provide plenty of short exercises for which children must select the more suitable phrase to complete a sentence.
The boy swam (in the pool; on the roof).
Make a sentence 
Have children make up sentences that include given prepositional phrases.
before dawn   We left before dawn.
across the sky   A jet roared across the sky.
Opposite match 
Have children match prepositional phrases with opposite meanings.
at dawn   at sunset
down the steps   up the stairs
Add a phrase 
Have children add prepositional phrases of their own to make sentences more interesting.
We left the house.   We left the house before noon.
The girl fed the puppy.   The girl with red hair fed the puppy.
Where should the phrase go? 
Make up a number of sentences with the prepositional phrases incorrectly placed. Have children rewrite the sentences correctly.
The jet plane was piloted by a lady with four engines.  The jet plane with four engines was piloted by a lady.
How, when, or where? 
Provide children with a number of sentences with adverbial prepositional phrases.  Have them identify whether each tells how, when or where. 
with a friendly smile (how); in the box (where); before nine o'clock (when)
Students can complete the activity sheets after you finish one or more of these activities with the class.

"Title: Readers' Theater
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Oral Language, Listening, Speaking
Objective: Students will participate in Readers' Theater productions with a baseball theme.  Readers' Theater is drama without costumes, props, stage, or memorization.  It is done in the classroom by groups of students who become the cast of the dramatic reading.
Directions: Ideas
You can give the students the two activity sheets using the book, Bobby Baseball.  The first gives them specific sections of the book that they have to re-write as Readers' Theater productions.  The second page gives them some more general instructions for writing Readers' Theater scripts about baseball or other childrens' books.

Staging
Your classroom is the stage.  Place four or five chairs or stools in a semicircle at the front of your class or in a separate staging area.  If you have no stools, have students sit on the tops of their desks, facing the audience.  Students may use simple costumes like hats or coats, but generally no costumes are used in this type of dramatization. 
If you have plain robes or simple coats of the same color or style so that everyone looks about the same, this can have a nice effect.  Students dressed in the same school uniform or colors create an atmosphere of seriousness.  Props are not needed, but they may be used for additional details.

Scripting
Readers' Theater can be done using a standard play format.  It is also easy to convert well-written dialogue from children's literature into a dramatic format. 
Keep the number of actors to four or five.  The most important reader with the largest amount of text is the narrator.  You can easily have the narrator role divided between two actors, if the text is long. 
If you choose a children's book, such as Bobby Baseball, find a selection with a good deal of exciting or interesting dialogue.

Assign the narrator to the sections without quotes. 
Assign separate actors to each role in the dialogue, such as Dad, Bobby, Mom, Jason, and Grandpa.  If there are too many roles, have one actor do two parts. (Make sure these two parts don't have to talk to each other.)
Drop the inter-dialogue remarks such as he said, answered Dad, or remarked Jason. 
Copy the text so that each child has a clearly marked, useable script.
Place scripts in folders that are uniform in color and size.
Allow children to practice for several days before presenting in front of the class. 


Performing
Students should enter quietly and seriously into a dimly lit room, with their scripts held in the same position.  Actors should sit silently and unmoving on the stools or desks and wait with heads lowered or alternatively focusing on a point above the audience such as a clock.  The narrator should start reading and the actors will then focus on their scripts. The actors should focus on whoever is reading, except when they are performing.

Extension
Encourage students to add movement and memorization to performances after several experiences with Readers' Theater.  They can introduce mime to the performance and add props or costumes, as the circumstances allow.  Some students may begin to add accents as they become more familiar with the drama.

"Title: Root Words
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Vocabulary
Objective: Students find root words from compound words.
Directions: Grammar is also concerned with the way an overall composition is structured to engage an audience and to deliver its message and with the way we choose particular words appropriate to that audience and message.  It is important to generate an interest in words and to encourage children to be thoughtful about the words they use.  If children develop an interest in language at an early age, they should continue throughout their school life and into adulthood appreciating the richness and diversity of our ever-growing language.
Concepts third and fourth graders should become familiar with follow.
Root words, prefixes, and suffixes
It is often helpful to see a word in terms of its various parts.  These parts are called the root, the prefix, and the suffix.
The root word is the word from which other words are built.
Example:  kind
A prefix is a group of letters placed at the beginning of a word.  It changes the meaning or use of the root word.
Example:  un + kind  =  unkind
A suffix is a group of letters added to the end of a word. (Sometimes spelling changes have to be made.) Suffixes also affect the meanings and uses of root words.
Example:  unkindly:



un
kind
ly


prefix
root
suffix

Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students learn the importance of precise directions when drawing a map or giving directions to a specific location.
Directions: Discuss with students the importance of giving precise directions.  Have some fun by having one student provide oral directions for another blindfolded student.  (Be sure that there are no safety hazards.)
Distribute the Sequential Words reference sheet to students and discuss the use of these words.
Distribute the Treasure Map activity sheet and, as a class, provide directions to the treasure.  Emphasize to students the important information needed to write any directions.

Include directional words such as east, west, north, south, right, and left.
Include appropriate sequential and number words.
Name important landmarks.
Be certain to provide directions in the correct order. 
If one is not available, draw a simple map.


Present examples of places to which students may write directions:

from home to school
to the mall from home
to the grocery store from home
to the playground from the classroom
from the classroom to the library
from the classroom to the lunchroom

"Title: Similes and Metaphors
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing
Objective: Students practice writing creatively through the use of similes and metaphors.
Directions: Define similes and metaphors for students.  A simile is a comparison of two different things using words such as like or as.  For example: I'm hungry as a bear.  A metaphor compares two different things as if they are the same, without using comparison words such as like or as.  For example: The moon is a white Frisbee floating over the mountain.
Emphasize to students the importance of writing creatively.  A good way for them to warm up their creative muscles before starting the activity sheets is to have them play with similes as a class.  Have them complete sentences such as: 
I feel limp as a(n). . . 
I feel happy as a(n). . . 
I feel strong as a(n). . . 
I feel silly as a(n). . . 
I feel light as a(n). . . 
I feel as grumpy as a(n). . . 
I feel as hungry as a(n). . . 
I feel sleepy as a(n). . .

"Title: Terrific Topic Sentences
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing
Objective: Students write paragraphs with topic sentences that capture their reader's attention.  They create sentences from writing prompts and restate sentences as questions, commands, or exclamations.
Directions: A topic sentence states a paragraph's main idea.  It also serves to capture the reader's attention.  Most expository paragraphs begin with declarative sentences, but a writer can add variety by starting with a question, command, or interjection that expresses strong feelings or emotions.  This lesson is designed to give students practice in writing topic sentences that make main ideas clear and also appealing to their audience.

Procedure:
I.  Lesson Introduction
A. Begin the lesson with a discussion about whales.  Talk about their size, where whales live, and how these creatures interact with humans.  Ask volunteers to create a declarative sentence, interrogative sentence, imperative sentence, and an exclamatory sentence using the topic 
""killer whales"" (orcas).  Explain to the pupils that a topic sentence needs to be interesting and attention-getting.  Most expository writing begins with topic sentences that are declarative, or statements.  Sometimes a writer will add variety to a piece by beginning with a question, command, or interjection that expresses emotion.
B. Direct the learners to read the paragraph about whales that goes with this lesson.  Have them locate and state the topic sentence.  Next, the pupils will brainstorm and attempt to restate that sentence in the form of a question, command, or exclamation.  A group of sample responses is provided.
II.  Lesson Body
A. Introduce the lesson practice worksheet.  The students will be given writing prompts and then asked to create a list of topic sentences.  Declarative statements will be acceptable for these exercises.  When these statements are given, the writers are asked to transform each into a question, command, or exclamation.  
B. A review of the four types of sentences (declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory) and end punctuation may be necessary (page 41).  Remind the students that most expository writing begins with declarative sentences, but writers will occasionally vary their styles and use questions, commands, and exclamations to maintain interest and challenge their audiences.
C. For reinforcement and reteaching, first gather together a collection of newspapers and periodicals.  Have the pupils identify a story of interest and then state its topic sentence.  After that, practice transforming these into questions, commands, and exclamations.  
D. Extend the lesson by using these articles to practice summary writing skills.  Also practice writing conclusion sentences in the form of questions, commands, or exclamations.  This will provide a unique way to end compositions.
III.  Lesson Conclusion
A. Close the lesson by having the pupils restate the purpose of a topic sentence.  They must also list different strategies that can be applied to make topic sentences more interesting and attractive to their audience.  Students will be asked to employ these techniques in future writing assignments.
B. Writing Applications:  Whales like the orca, dolphin, and porpoise are often trained to entertain or assist humans with certain water-related tasks.  Instruct the students to write a paragraph about an animal that performs in a show or is trained to work with people for a common goal.  It may be an animal with which they have had personal experience or one observed at a circus, water park, or on television.  Tell them to begin by stating topic sentences in the form of questions, commands, or exclamations.
C. Publishing Project: 
1. Group students together that have written about the same or similar animals.  Have them read their compositions to each other and then share their reactions and feelings within the small group.
2. Computer Connection:  Many animal theme parks, zoos, and circuses have home pages listed on the Internet.  Allow the pupils to locate and view a few of these Web sites to help them research further information for their writing applications. 
IV.  Evaluation:
A. Use the discussion questions and worksheets to measure student progress and skill mastery.
B. Writing Applications:  Use the four-point rubric scale to determine if students can independently, can usually, or require assistance to write detailed descriptions of familiar, persons, places, objects, or experiences.

"Title: Thesaurus Power
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Vocabulary
Objective: Given a thesaurus entry, the students will list and apply its synonyms to sentence writing.
Students will use a thesaurus to locate an entry's part of speech, definition, list of synonyms, and list of antonyms.
Directions: The intermediate level is the age at which the thesaurus must be introduced and utilized.  During the elementary years, dictionary skills are practiced and then applied.  Next, glossaries appear in the backs of reading, mathematics, science, and social studies textbooks, and students work with these references.  By fourth grade, pupils understand the concept of synonyms and antonyms.  A thesaurus becomes an important tool to help these youngsters increase and refine their writing and speaking vocabularies.  This lesson is designed to offer practice using a thesaurus.  Students will learn to add variety to their written compositions and eliminate repetitive language while revising.
Goal:  
Students will use a thesaurus when revising and rewriting compositions.
Procedure:
I.  Lesson Introduction
A.Prepare a list of synonyms for the word ""money""  (e.g., dough, jack, simoleons, long green, bucks, cabbage, shekels, yellow boys, hard cash, bank, chicken feed).  Explain that our English language has a larger, richer vocabulary than most other languages.  A strategy to use in order to take advantage of our colorful language is to practice thesaurus skills.  A thesaurus is a book of synonyms and antonyms.  Writers look up common and overused words in a thesaurus in order to find synonyms.  These synonyms help make compositions more interesting and less repetitive.
B.Inform the students that they are at an age where word choice is more crucial than it was during their elementary years.  Overused words must be identified and modified while revising and proofreading a paragraph.  Present the following list of words and have the pupils brainstorm a list of synonyms for each:



 1.   
 good   
 2.   
 nice   
 3.   
 big   
 4.   
 run   
 5.   
 eat   




Next allow time for the students to share their brainstormed lists.  Finally, let the students skim through a thesaurus to discover how this book is organized.  Instruct them to locate these entries and add more synonyms to their lists.
II.  Lesson Body
A.Introduce the lesson worksheet.  Point out that entries in most thesauruses are similar to those found in a dictionary.  Each word's part of speech, definition, and a sample sentence are present.  Unlike a dictionary or glossary, a thesaurus contains synonyms and antonyms for each entry.  Exercise A will help students familiarize and practice basic thesaurus research skills.
B.Exercise B has students applying the entry's synonyms in context.  Pupils must study each sentence carefully and choose the best synonym from the given list.  By selecting the correct word, the sentence will be more exact and more descriptive.
C.Exercise C asks students to look up a given word in an actual thesaurus and then use its synonyms to improve a list of sentences.  The goal is to get students to replace overused words with more interesting, higher-level synonyms.
III.  Lesson Conclusion
A.Students are to state the purpose of a thesaurus and how it supplements a dictionary or glossary.  They are to list the basic elements of a quality thesaurus (entry words, part of speech, definition, sample sentences, lists of synonyms, lists of antonyms) and tell where to find this book on the reference shelf (in the same area as the dictionaries).
B.Writing Applications:  Students are to locate in a thesaurus a common word that has at least five listed synonyms.  Next, they are to copy the entry, its part of speech, and synonym list.  Finally, the pupils are to create sample sentences for five of the synonyms.
C.Publishing Project:

The teacher will collect the portfolio work and assemble it into a class thesaurus of commonly overused terms.  The class will refer to this booklet during the revision step of future writing assignments.
Computer Connection:  Demonstrate the thesaurus option on the task bar of a word-processing program.  Encourage the writers to explore this function when creating future compositions and reports.

IV.  Evaluation
A.Use the discussion questions, practice exercises, and lesson worksheets to measure student progress and skill mastery.
B.Writing Applications:  Use the four-point rubric scale to determine if students can independently, can usually, or require assistance to use the thesaurus to improve their vocabulary.

Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Vocabulary, Writing, Grammar
Objective: The students will use action verbs to provide clarification and description in writing.
Directions: Introducing the Skill
Preparation: Reproduce the Student Resource Sheet (page 14) for students and make a copy for yourself to use as a teaching reference.
Directions: Distribute the Student Resource Sheet to students.  Tell students WHAT skill they will be learning.  Explain WHY writers use this skill and WHY it will make your students' writing better.  Show several examples of WHEN this skill is used.  Teach students HOW to use this skill.

Practicing the Skill
Preparation: Reproduce the Student Practice Sheets (pages 15 and 16) for students.
Directions: Assign the practice sheets to students according to their needs and abilities.  You may wish to have students work on these sheets in one or more of the following ways: as a whole-class activity, with a partner, in small groups, or independently.  As an alternative, you may prefer to use one or both sheets as homework assignments.  Provide feedback to students to ensure mastery of the skill.

Applying the Skill
Preparation: Write verbs on slips of paper.  You will need enough slips for each student in the class to have one.  Place the slips in a container, such as a hat, bag, or small box.  The following verbs work well for this activity.

Directions: Tell students that they are going to play a version of charades.  Choose a student to select a slip of paper from the container.  Instruct that student to read the word on the slip of paper to him/herself.  The student should then act out the word for the class.  The rest of the class should try to guess what word is on the slip of paper based on the action being performed.  Continue with the game until all students have had a chance to act out a word.  Depending on the size of your class, you may want the students in small groups for this activity.

"Title: Voice Trait: Who Is Talking?
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing
Objective: Given writing samples, the student will identify strong voice by answering specific questions.  Given a description of a fictional character, the student will write in the person's voice.
Directions: Preparation
Copy pages 39-40 onto either one transparency or onto five separate transparencies so that you can display the sample letters to students one at a time.
Lesson Opening
Ask students if they are able to tell who wrote the letter to you just by seeing the envelope.  Might they be able to identify the author if they read it?
Lesson Directions

Review the characteristics of the voice trait.
Show one overhead or one letter at a time from pages 39-40.  Ask the students questions about each piece of writing:
    
Who do you think wrote this?
Who is talking here?  Is it a male or female?  How old is the person?
What might this person's job be?
Does the writing sound like a real person talking?


List specific characters on the board, e.g., a 17-year-old football player, an 80-year-old book seller, etc.  Have students write a letter to the class in the voice of one character.

Lesson Closing
Read two or three student paragraphs aloud anonymously.  Ask the class if they can match the paragraph to a character on the board, and if so, which one.  Does it sound like that person wrote it?  or did the student's own voice come through?

One day before the day you plan to conduct this simulation, play the old game of ""telephone"" with the students.  Whisper a message into the ear of the first student.  In turn, that student is to whisper what he or she heard to the next student, and so on until all the students have received a message.  The game works best when the message is a simple one such as, ""Mary went to answer the phone, but when she got there the phone was dead.""  Vary the difficulty of the message with the level of the students in the class.  Whisper the message only once, and instruct the students to do the same.  When the last student has received a message, instruct the students to write down what they heard without saying anything until all have finished writing.  Then have the last student say aloud the message received.  Compare the messages each of the students heard.  Discuss how messages change when passed from one person to the next and how difficult it sometimes is to get an unexpected message straight.  
Steps:
This part of the simulation should take place the day following the game of ""telephone,"" and requires the help of another adult and two students from outside the present class.  These persons should be ones you can rely on to keep a secret.  Tell them that you wish to prepare an activity for your class which will increase your students' abilities to observe and report, and you need them to be actors.
Give the students and adult actors the script on the activity page (page 55).  Ask them to learn the script.  Plan ahead the day on which you are going to complete the simulation, but do not tell the students in your class that anything unusual is going to occur on that day.
On the day which has been planned, direct the actors to act out the script as printed.  The entire scene should take no more than two or three minutes to complete.
When the actors leave the room, do not discuss with the students what has just happened.  Instead, distribute the questionnaire activity page (page 56) and direct them to answer the questions.
Collect the papers which the students have completed.  Discuss their responses to the questions and how they might better observe and record another event for which they are unprepared.  Explain to them that often after an automobile accident or an altercation of some sort, different witnesses will give varying and sometimes contradictory accounts of what occurred.  When this happens, it can cause problems for police officers or other officials trying to discern what really occurred.
Follow-Up:
An ability to observe and make accurate written reports is essential for many careers and professions.  Give the students several opportunities to observe and report in order to hone their abilities.  Some possibilities might include three-minute observations followed by written descriptions of the following:
-- people going into and out of the school office
-- people on the sidelines watching a game
-- students at one table in the school cafeteria
-- students waiting for the bus after school
Have students write a description of a character, real or imagined.  Explain that one can tell what a person is like by the way that person looks, by what that person says, by what that person does, and by what other people say about that person.  Their characterizations should include a physical description and an example of that person doing something which shows that person's character or personality.

"Title: Book Report Haiku
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Writing, Traits of Writing
Objective: Students will explore an alternate method of writing a book report.
Directions: Present the following to students:
The Setting Haiku

How would you like to be able to write a book report in just three short lines?  Does it sound like a dream come true?  Before you get too excited and decide that this is the book report for you because it will be easy, give it some thought.  That is exactly what this book report will require: careful thought.  In this book report you will describe the setting of your story with a haiku and an illustration.  

First, think about the setting of your book.  How do you see it?  Does it take place at a space station in the stars?  another planet?  Go back and look in your book for descriptions of the setting.  Write some notes and brainstorm.  List some of the items and what they look like.  One student listed for her setting: magnetized travel pods, large crystals, a desert-like planet, two suns, hot temperatures on the planet's surface, cool underground, gray concrete maze-like tunnels.

Next, draw your setting.  Include as many things from your list as you can.

Now write a haiku.  Haiku is a form of Japanese poetry.  It has three lines.  The first and last lines have just five syllables and no more.  The second line has seven syllables.  Haiku requires thought because each word is important in describing the mood or feeling of a scene or setting.  A haiku usually focuses on just one or two images that suggest a time of day, a season, a physical place, or what is special about something in nature.  The haiku writer focuses on the senses and what the setting means to him or her.  Here is a typical haiku:

Dolphins in the waves,
Sliding down the sloping sea;
I join with my eyes.
The haiku is typical because it is about a setting in nature, and it indicates the writer's response.  Here are some haikus based on book settings:
Winter light sparkles
Coating all the prairie sod
With sparkling sprinkles
Solid wood beneath
Swirling winds torment above
Only safe right here

The first was written by a student who read one of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books.  The haiku describes a winter scene from one of the chapters.  Notice all the ""s"" sounds she used?  

Repetitive use of a sound is a poetic tool known as alliteration.  The second haiku is by a student who read a book about some boys who survived a storm in a treehouse fort.  

Here is the haiku written by the girl who brainstormed above (compare her brainstormed list with her haiku):

Crystals, magnets zoom
Cool wind whooshing through gray tubes
Leaving heat above.
Distribute the activity sheets and have students write their own setting haikus.

"Title: Color Poems
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students write poems using similes to describe colors from every sense but sight, requiring them to think about a topic that is primarily visual but describe it without using any visual references.
Directions: Background for the Teacher
Preparation: Reproduce the Sensational Colors worksheet and the Color Poem Response and Assessment Sheet.  Gather other materials needed for the lesson.

Lesson Plan

Prewriting

Ask students to close their eyes.  Call on one student and ask that student to describe what the color red looks like.  Most likely, the student will have difficulty and end up saying something like, ""Red is red.  I don't know!""  The student might make comparisons to red objects, saying, ""Red is like strawberries or a fire engine.""  Ask the student to further describe, saying ""I don't know what a strawberry looks like.  What do you mean?""  You may need to assist by offering, ""Perhaps red on a strawberry is rough but sweet-tasting.""
Have students describe another color in the same manner, trying to avoid visual images and instead offering other sensory descriptions--texture, taste, sound, or smell.  If a student uses a visual comparison (""Yellow is like the sun.""), prompt the student to offer more information using other senses: ""Yellow is burning, bright, and hot.""
Distribute one crayon to each student.  Instruct students to sit with other students who have the same color of crayon.   This will be their writing group for the color poem.

Drafting

Tell students that they will be writing a poem about a color.  They are to write the poem as if they were writing it for a person who has a visual handicap.  The person may not know what certain objects look like so they cannot write about things that are the color.  Instead, instruct students that they are to describe their color from each of the other senses: sound, smell, taste, and feel.
Remind students that they will be using similes to compare their color to different sounds, smells, tastes, and textures.
Distribute the Sensational Colors worksheet to each group of students.  Review the directions with them before completing the sheet.
When groups have completed the brainstorming worksheet, share several sample color poems with them, either the four found at the bottom of this lesson plan or others found at the ""Have You Heard the Sound of . . . ?"" Web site.  Point out particularly effective word choices.  Elicit student feedback regarding the comparisons the authors used.  Note the structure of the poems for students.
Instruct groups to review their ideas from the Sensational Colors worksheet and select those ideas which make the strongest comparison for each sense.  Tell students to use their ideas to draft each line of the color poem.  Provide a color poem outline (page 76) for students to use, if necessary, for drafting their poems.

Revising/Editing

Once the poems are drafted, students should share their color poems with peer responders.  Provide the Color Poem Response and Assessment Sheet for this purpose.  Peer responders should check to make sure that each line describes the color through a different sense, that no visual comparisons have been used, and that similes are used in each line.  Responders could also make suggestions for stronger word choice as appropriate.
Following peer response, students should make any necessary revisions before writing a final copy of the poem.

Publishing
Students could write their final copy of the color poem in the same color ink as their topic and mount it on poster board.  They could then cover the poster board with scraps of material that matches their topic color.  Try to obtain a wide variety of textured materials such as corduroy, silk, cotton, flannel, wallpaper samples, corrugated paper, carpet samples, etc.  This will provide a textured backing to enhance their ""non-visual"" color poem.

White
White is like the sound of ice cubes clinking in a glass.

White is like the smell of freshly picked daisies from a green, green meadow.

White is like the taste of sweet, creamy ice cream on a hot summer day.

White is like the feel of a soft, fluffy pillow comforting you to sleep.

Blue
Blue smells like the fresh, salty ocean as the breeze blows across it.

Blue sounds like a peaceful river flowing through the forest.

Blue tastes like a slippery, sweet lollipop energizing you in the middle of the afternoon.

Blue feels like soaring through the air with the birds and the clouds.

Brown
Brown is like the taste of rich, thick chocolate as you smooth it around on your tongue.

Brown is like the smell of tangy spices, soaking into barbecued meat.

Brown is like the sound of construction equipment, struggling to move the earth.

Brown is like the feeling of sluggishness, like lying around all day.

Pink
Pink tastes like light, sugary cotton candy you get at the circus.

Pink smells like a baby just after a bath.

Pink sounds like tiny, glass wind chimes blowing in the breeze.

Pink feels like a light feather tickling your skin.

"Title: Combining Art and Writing
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Journaling, Art, Mediums
Objective: Students use art as another medium of expression to awaken creativity.
Directions: Combining art and writing is a natural way to increase student creativity.  Writing teachers often allow students to illustrate stories, but it can be very worthwhile to allow students to draw first and write second.

Student Practice: The exercise on the activity page is adapted from Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain by Betty Edwards.  It is designed to help students think about their writing from an intuitive, ""right-brained"" perspective, as opposed to the rule-bound ""left-brained"" manner of using language.
The exercise directs the students to create a border around their papers and draw within it objects that are found along the walls of the classroom.

Ask students to select one object and write about events or students in the classroom from that object's perspective.  For example, if a student chooses the clock, then he or she might write an essay on time spent in the classroom or changes in the room down through the years.
Encourage students to caption their artwork, as this provides another way for students to self-evaluate their work.

Extension: Ask students to do the same exercise, using a room in their homes.  Students may wish to view a piece of fine artwork and write a story about the scene they encounter.  Students may also wish to select their own previously created works of art and write about the inspiration for their work or create a story around it.

"Title: Comic and Film Strip Writing Lesson
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing, Art, Mediums, Techniques
Objective: Students will tell a short, funny story with the use of words and pictures.  Students will be able to express themselves using comedic writing and pictures.  This type of writing encourages students to be creative and to use detailed pictures to express the plot of a story.
Directions: Multiple Intelligence Connections
Linguistic-Write a dialogue or story line of a comic or filmstrip.
Spatial-Illustrate a comic or film strip.
Bodily-Kinesthetic-Manipulate a film strip; sequence a scrambled comic strip.
Logical-Mathematical-Sequence the logical order of a comic; determine the number of boxes needed for a comic or film strip.
Interpersonal-Peer edit work; share work with the class or partner.
Intrapersonal-Write a first draft; practice for an oral presentation.
Musical-Create a theme song or sound effects for a comic strip; analyze cartoons and their theme songs.
Naturalist-Create a comic about nature and the environment.

Instructions
Creating a Comic Strip

Encourage students to look at various comic strips and discuss what they think the artist is trying to say or the theme of the story being told.  Analyze the type of characters in the strips and how the author only uses a limited number of boxes to tell a story of.  Also, discuss how students can improve the comic strip or if it even needs to be improved.  (Note:  Pick a well-known comic strip and compare it to an unknown one.  Ask students what they think makes one comic strip so popular.)
Distribute a piece of lined paper and a piece of blank paper or Worksheet #1 to each student.  Brainstorm various ideas about which students want to write.  Students may pick a topic in which they are interested in for their first comic strips or you may assign a topic.
Allow students to decide what their characters are like and what story they want to write about them.  Tell them to write a few notes describing the characters on the lined paper.
Encourage students to write a short paragraph about the story line under their character descriptions for their comic strips.
Instruct students to break their short story into sections.  They can do this through either story events or changes in setting.
Students draw a detailed picture that explains what each section is about on unlined paper folded into eight squares, or they may use Worksheet #1.  Remind students to leave room for dialogue.
On the unlined paper or Worksheet #1, have them transfer the pictures and words needed to help the comic strip make sense.

Creating a Film Strip
A film strip can be used to sequence the events of a story or for students to write their own stories.  
The following are directions for sequencing stories.

Read a story or a chapter book as a class.
Discuss the main events of the story.
Distribute Worksheet #2.  Instruct students to sequence the main events of the story in the order that they happened.
Direct students to choose four main events, in the story, to illustrate, that will help describe the plot of the story.
In the boxes on Worksheet #2, instruct students to illustrate the four events in the order in which they happen.  Tell students they will need to write a sentence summarizing the event in each box on the lines below it.  (Note:  Challenge the students by instructing them to summarize the story in paragraph format, and to use only four boxes to illustrate it.)

Comic Boxes

Explain to students that they are going to learn about onomatopoeia.  Tell them that onomatopoeia is a big word used to describe sounds like oink or bark.  These words imitate the sound that an object makes, like a clock ticking, a person humming, or an animal growling.
Brainstorm different objects or things and the sounds they make.  For example, cat--meow; dog--bark; clock--tick--tock, etc.
Distribute Worksheet #3.  Instruct students that they are going to draw a picture of an object and the sound it makes in the comic boxes on the worksheet.  There should be two objects per box, and the objects should be related.

Variations

Emerging Writers
Cut apart a comic strip and make a transparency of each frame.  Display the frames one at a time, allowing students to predict what will happen next in the strip.  Cut apart a progressive comic strip, scramble it, and have students put it back in order.  After students have practiced with various comic strips, make a properly sequenced strip with students using Worksheet #3.  Display transparencies of amusing drawings without captions or other text.  Ask students to suggest funny captions or text for dialogue bubbles.  Students can use their ideas for the basis of a comic or filmstrip.

Experienced Writers
Have students do some research on the history of comic strips.  Also, research artists who create comic strips.  If students are especially interested in comic strips, have them write a longer and more in-depth comic book following the same instructions above.  Students can also take an issue that they may face in their daily lives and make a strip about it.  For mature students, the comic strip can be about a political issue.  They can study political cartoons in political magazines or newspapers for ideas.  Finally, students can compare and contrast different comic strips.

Evaluation
The instructor will be able to check the final project for the following items:

Did the student separate the story into different sections?
Did the pictures match each section?
Did the comic strip make sense and follow a sequence?
Did the student spell the words correctly?


Extensions

Watch cartoons in order to listen to their theme songs.  Discuss how the songs match the characters or theme of the show.  Ask students to write their own theme songs for their comic strip.
Compare and contrast the differences between a comic strip and a television cartoon based on that comic strip.
Seek out collections of older comics and ask older students to study them.  What themes were important then that seem old-fashioned now?  What themes have remained the same?
Make simple animated flip books, such as a child kicking a ball.  Discuss with students how they will need to think about motion and slow it down by drawing many pictures.  Students draw their animated activity on small sheets of paper.  They should flip their books before stapling them in order to see if they need to add more drawings.  When the drawings are completed, staple them along one side and invite students to exchange their flip books with one another.

"Title: Compare and Contrast
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Editing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing
Objective: Students learn the elements of and write comparison and contrast paragraphs.
Directions: To begin this activity, review with students what a paragraph is.  Tell them that a paragraph is a smaller unit of a larger piece of writing, just as a fabric square is a smaller unit of a quilt.  A paragraph has a beginning, middle, and end.

The first sentence of a paragraph is the topic sentence.  It tells what the paragraph will be about.  A sentence like "":I go to school,"" is a weak topic sentence because it doesn't tell anything about what you will be saying about going to school.  A topic sentence that says, ""I go to a very strange school,"" is not only more interesting, it tells something about what you will be saying.

The middle of the paragraph contains sentences which follow the topic sentence and add specific details to make the topic more interesting or help explain what you mean.  Every sentence in the middle of the paragraph, or the body, needs to be about the topic stated in the topic sentence.  If you were to use the topic sentence about going to a strange school, a middle sentence might say, ""From a distance my school looks like a space ship.""

The last sentence of your paragraph is the concluding sentence, or closing.  This sentence reminds the reader of what the topic is about or what it means.  For the paragraph about going to a strange school, this could be a closing sentence: ""Because of its shape, location, and the strange noises coming from the factory down the hill, it is clear that I go to a strange school.""

Introduce students to the idea of comparison and contrast paragraphs.  Describe the method of writing about two things and explaining how they are the same and how they are different.

"Title: Conjunctions
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Grammar
Objective: Students learn about and practice using conjunctions.
Directions: Introduction
Conjunctions can join compound subjects and compound predicates as well as serve to create compound sentences.
Examples:
compound subject--Jerrie and Mac went on a trip.
compound predicate--They would sail and fly.
compound sentence--Jerrie chose Russia, and Mac chose India.
Point out to students that whenever sentences are joined by the conjunctions and, but, and or, a comma usually goes before the conjunction as in the compound sentence above.
coordinating conjunctions (to join groups of words, including compound subjects, predicates, and sentences): and, but, or
subordinating conjunctions (to join main and subordinate clauses for complex sentences):  when, while, since, though, until, although, unless, whether, because
relative pronouns (to join main and subordinate clauses for complex sentences): who, whom, which, that
 Teaching Strategies 
Glue for words. Tear a piece of paper in two and show children how it can be joined with glue or sticky tape.  Now write two sentences on the board.  Show children how these can be joined also, but this time instead of glue or sticky tape we use a comma and a conjunction.
I washed the dishes. Sally dried them.
I washed the dishes, and Sally dried them.
You must hurry. You will miss the train.
You must hurry, or you will miss the train.
Provide children with numerous simple and informal exercises, having them suggest words suitable to join the sentences.
After the join 
Have children orally finish sentences you have written on the chalkboard.
We laughed when . . . 
I have not seen him since . . .
I was scared because . . .
I will not help you unless . . .
Use the conjunction
Provide children with exercises in which they use a given conjunction to join pairs of sentences.
Use a comma and but.



 Mike is tall. Tom is short.   
 Mike is tall, but Tom is short.   


 A fire is hot. Ice is cold.   
 A fire is hot, but ice is cold.   



Choose the conjunction  Provide a list of conjunctions on the chalkboard and have children finish sentences by using each one.



 because   
 and   
 before   




I cleaned my teeth ______ I went to bed.
We did not go ______ it was raining.
Tom grabbed the apple, _____ he ate it.
Conjunction search 
Conduct a conjunction search from a common text, such as a photocopy of a story or poem already read.  Have children read the text and circle any conjunctions they find.
Which conjunction? 
Have children orally suggest suitable conjunctions for sentences which you read out loud.
I cannot come. My leg is sore. (if, because . . .)
In the beginning
Remind students that a conjunction need not necessarily come in the middle to join two sentences.  Provide exercises encouraging children to begin the sentence with the conjunction.
He did not come. He is ill.
He did not come because he is ill.
Because he is ill, he did not come.

"Title: Convincing Characters
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing
Objective: Students learn how to create vivid, active characters.
Directions: Introduction
Creating a believable person requires more than knowing what the character likes and dislikes.  There are specific types of characters that authors need to place in their stories.  The most common characters, of course, are the hero (protagonist) and the enemy (antagonist).  (For brevity's sake, hero will be used to designate both male and female main characters.)  Most students will probably produce stories with only these two characters, but more sophisticated writers may want to include other types such as the helper and the wise person.
The hero must be someone with whom the reader can identify, but like a real person, one who cannot be all good.  Not all heroes are equally motivated to face the problems that they will encounter within the story.  The hero also can be any age and from any walk of life.
The enemy is usually a person who stands in the way of the hero's goal, but it may also be something in the environment. (Spiders and tornadoes come to mind!)  Enemies are not necessarily mean; sometimes they just have a point of view that differs from the hero's.
The helper may do a number of things, from pointing out possible solutions to creating comic relief.
The wise person is someone in whom the hero confides or who may have special knowledge that can help the hero obtain his or her goal and experience internal change.
Student Practice
Discuss the characters in works with which you are familiar.  Ask students to help create a brief list of novels they have read and discuss the various character types that appear within these books.  Think about the nature of each hero.  Is each one completely good, or does each have a flaw that gets them into trouble?  Who, or what, is the enemy in the book?  Is there a wise person?  A helper?  Any other character types?  Provide students with copies of page 38 to help them create characters.  For variety, reproduce and laminate page 39, cut out the cards, and make a few sets of character shuffle cards for the class to use.  Students can create new and interesting stories based on the characters they choose from the shuffle cards.
Extensions
As a logical extension, ask students to draft stories using the characters they have created.  You may wish to use read-around groups of four or five students in which peer editors judge each other's characters for believability.

"Title: Definition Poems
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing
Objective: Students will write definition poems, which are free verse poems using metaphors to describe the topic.
Directions: Prewriting

Tell students that a definition poem uses a conceptual topic--something that is not an object, person, or place, but is instead an emotion, feeling, or way of being.
On a chart, chalkboard, or overhead projector, help students brainstorm possible conceptual topics.  Possible concepts include freedom, jealousy, love, friendship, hope, anger, sadness, independence, time, fear, death, life, etc.
Share the student sample, ""Hope is . . ."" (page 83).  Read the poem once for students to gain an idea of the form of the poem, which is free verse.
Read the poem a second time, asking students to list each item that the author compares to hope.
Review the term metaphor with students.  Ask students why the author compared hope to each of the items.  For example, after reading, ""Hope is a tissue, wiping away your problems and fears,"" ask students, ""Why does the author think hope is like a tissue?""
Have students select a topic for their poems from the list the class brainstormed during prewriting.  (Note: Depending on the skill level of your students, you may wish to have students work in groups to write this challenging poem.)
Using the Definition Poem Web worksheet, have students make comparisons between their topic and other objects.  The web is designed in two tiers: the first offshoot from the topic is for students to write the objects to be compared; the second offshoot is for elaborating on the comparison.

Drafting
Once students have generated several comparisons and elaborations, instruct them to begin drafting their definition poem.  Review student sample, Hope is . . . (see the link to the activity pages below) to show students a possible format for their poem. 
Since a definition poem is free verse, students could take liberties with the structure of the poem as long as the metaphors are included and complete.
Revising/Editing

When the poem is drafted, students should share their definition poems with peer responders.  Provide the Definition Poem Response and Assessment Sheet for this purpose.  Peer responders should check to make sure that the topic is compared to several items without using like or as, that each comparison is elaborated for explanation, and that each comparison makes sense.
Following peer response, students should make any necessary revisions before writing a final copy of the poem.

Publishing
Obtain several old dictionaries that can be torn apart or photocopy pages from a dictionary.  Have the students use the dictionary pages as backgrounds for their poems since they are writing a type of definition.  They should each mount the final copy of their poem on the dictionary page background.

"Title: Descriptive Verbs
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Grammar
Objective: The student will identify strong verbs in text.  The student will select strong, descriptive words to use in writing.
Directions: Procedure

Explain to the students that when writing descriptively, we tend to focus on the use of adjectives, but verbs can be descriptive, too.
Write the sentences below on chart paper.
    
The animals ran in the forest.
The animals frolicked in the forest.


Point out to the students that the verb ran is acceptable to use, but the word frolicked is much more descriptive.  It tells us that the animals were moving briskly and playfully through the forest.  
Write the following list of verbs on chart paper and have the students brainstorm descriptive verbs that can replace them.  (Suggested verbs are in parentheses.)
    
talk (whisper, chat, mutter)
yell (shriek, scream, bellow)
jump (leap, hop, bound)
eat (gobble, nibble, taste)
see (peer, spy, witness)
close (latch, block, bolt)
laugh (giggle, snicker, chuckle)


Read aloud the article, Sweden's Igloo Inn on page 76.
As you read, have the students raise their hands when they hear descriptive verbs.  Write these verbs on chart paper.  Ask the following questions:
    
How do these verbs add to the story?
Were you able to create visual images of the story?
Which descriptive words were particularly memorable? 


Explain that the author uses these verbs to give the reader a clearer visual image of what is happening in the story.
Next, distribute copies of magazines for the students.  Instruct the students to look for advertisements with descriptive verbs.  
As they find the verbs, the students cut them out and glue them onto construction paper.  Have the students store the pages in their writing portfolios for future reference.
Distribute student copies of Using Descriptive Verbs on page 77.  The students should complete the page by writing a series of descriptive verbs for each verb listed.
Ask each student to select a previously written story from his or her writing portfolio.  
Instruct the student to underline all of the verbs used.  The student should then replace each verb with a more descriptive verb.

Publication

Have the students recopy their stories with the newly added descriptive verbs.  Instruct partners to revise and edit their work.
Invite students to read their first and second versions of their stories.  Encourage classmates to respond to the changes made and the use of descriptive verbs.
Display student work on a board entitled, Vivid Verbs.

Extension

Show the students how to find new verbs by using the thesaurus feature of a word-processing program.  To use the feature in Microsoft Word, the student types a verb and then highlights it.  Then the student clicks on Tools in the menu bar at the top of the screen and selects Language . . . Thesaurus from the drop-down menu.  A window will appear, listing different word choices.  The student can select a word from the window to replace the word that was originally highlighted.
Instruct students to read two or three articles from magazines or newspapers.  The students will create a list of descriptive verbs found in the articles.
For added practice with using strong verbs, have the students complete Strong Verbs on page 78 and Using Strong Verbs on page 79.

"Title: Developing Listening Skills with Folktales
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Oral Language, Listening
Objective: Students use their listening skills to answer questions about a passage of literature that has been read aloud to them.
Directions: In this activity, students practice their listening skills as they hear a passage read aloud by the teacher. They then answer questions based on what they have heard.

Teacher Directions

Slowly, but with expression, read aloud each passage to the students.
    Tell them just to listen carefully the first time through.
    Tell them you will read it again.
They should take notes on important details the second time.
    Remind them to think of what was included on the student guide pages.
    Read the passage aloud to the students a second time, slowly but with expression.
When you are done, pass out the essay questions.
    The students may use only the notes they have taken to answer the questions; they may not see the passage at any time.
    Also, they must not know the questions prior to listening to the passage twice.
    The notes are not considered part of the grade and are just for their own use. 
Collect and score the essays.
On an overhead projector, display the essay questions.
    Read aloud an exemplary, average, and minimum essay response for each question (without revealing who the authors are).
    Talk about what made them exemplary, average, and minimally acceptable.
    Discuss what would be unacceptable responses as well. 


Scoring Student Responses
To make scoring the essays as quick and easy as possible, adhere to the answer key's specific point value for each statement a student makes.
If the statement is invalid or irrelevant, do not add or subtract anything.
Total the points to arrive at an overall score, then refer to the rubrics given on the answer key pages for each genre to arrive at the minimum passing, average, and exemplary scores.
Tell students: Here are some words you will need to know as you listen to this folktale:
audible:
able to be heard
devious:
deceptive, dishonest, untrustworthy
Passage #12-The Sick Lion 
One day the lion, king of all the beasts, was extremely ill.
He did not come out of his cave, but instead lay groaning and murmuring faint, barely audible roars whenever anyone came near.
The other animals did not know what to do.
For as long as they could remember the lion had made all their decisions.
They had long since forgotten how to think for themselves.
After much discussion, they agreed that they must visit him in his cave, for if they stayed away he would certainly be angry and they would suffer upon his recovering.
Besides, in his current condition he obviously couldn't harm them even if he wanted to.
So one at a time, or occasionally in small groups, the animals went to the royal cave.
Some took him a gift such as the best bit of meat from a recent catch.
Others just went to inquire about his health.
Large and small, each animal in the lion's kingdom all made their way to his dwelling.
However, the fox stayed away.
Eventually the lion noticed that the fox never visited him.
So the king sent his servant, a hyena, to inquire why the fox was being so rude.
""Fox,"" said the hyena, ""You have displeased His Majesty the lion.
Although he is desperately ill, you have not even put your nose inside his cave to ask how he is feeling.
What excuse do you have for your disrespectful behavior?""
The fox replied, ""Hyena, I would like to see the king, for I respect his wisdom.
Indeed, I once came right to the mouth of the cave bearing my best piece of meat as a get-well present.""
""And?"" the hyena prompted him.
""Although I was anxious to see the king, when I got there I noticed something that made me too frightened to go in,"" said the fox.
""And what was that?"" asked the hyena.
The fox replied, ""I saw many pairs of footprints in the sand from all sorts of animals.
But they were all going one way--into the cave.
Not a single footprint came out.
I did not want to enter a place from which I would never return.""
The clever fox had figured out the lion's devious plan.
Believing he was sick and harmless, the animals he usually had to chase down for food were all coming right into his cave--and ending up as his next meal.

"Title: Diamante
Grade Level: 3rd - 5th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing
Objective: Students will learn how to write diamantes.
Directions: Background for the Teacher
Definition
A diamante is a poem written in the shape of a diamond.  The form begins with a short line, its lines become progressively longer, and then its lines become shorter again.  The diamante has several pattern variations.  This lesson will teach students how to write a diamante using two opposite topics.
Skills Needed
Students need to have familiarity with the basic parts of speech (nouns, adjectives, verbs).
Preparation
Cut out the diamonds on the Diamante Diamonds reproducible.  Store diamonds in an envelope or plastic sandwich bag until needed for the lesson.  Reproduce the Absolutely Opposites worksheet and the Diamante Response and Assessment Sheet.  Reproduce and cut out a Diamond Design pattern for each student in the class.
Lesson Plan
Prewriting

Distribute one diamond cutout to each student at the beginning of class.  Instruct students to read the word on their diamond and locate the student who has the diamond with the opposite of their diamond word.  Allow students time to move around the room to locate their opposite partner.  Once students have located their partner, instruct them to sit together.  They will be writing partners for this lesson.
Distribute the Absolutely Opposites worksheet.  Instruct students to write one of the words from their diamonds in the box marked Opposite #1.  The opposite word from the other diamond should be written in the box marked Opposite #2. 
Instruct students to complete the worksheet, following the directions in the boxes.  Depending on the skill level of your students, you may need to review adjectives, verbs, and nouns.

Drafting

Once students have generated the content for their diamante, instruct them to draft the poem in diamond form.  The poem should be written in the following pattern:

































Line 1


                Opposite #1




Line 2


                2 adjectives describing Opposite #1




Line 3


                3 verbs related to Opposite #1




Line 4


                2 nouns related to Opposite #1; 2 nouns related to Opposite #2




Line 5


                3 verbs related to Opposite #2




Line 6


                2 adjectives describing Opposite #2




Line 7


                Opposite #2







Revising/Editing

When the poem is drafted, students should share their diamante with another pair of students.  Provide the Diamante Response and Assessment Sheet for this purpose.  Peer responders should check to make sure the correct format has been followed, including the number of words and parts of speech.  Students should also make sure that the poem resembles a diamond shape.
Following peer response, students should make any necessary revisions before writing a final copy of the poem.

Publishing
Students could write their diamante on a piece of white paper and mount it on a piece of construction paper or aluminum foil cut in the shape of a large diamond; the Diamond Design could be used by students to trace the shape of a diamond.  They could attach the poem to two other diamonds illustrating the opposites they wrote about in their poem.  The finished product is a string of three diamonds connected together, with the poem in the middle.  These look wonderful hanging from the ceiling or walls as a classroom display.  (Be sure to check on your school or district policy on hanging items from the ceiling before doing so.)

"Title: Flower Power
Grade Level: 3rd - 6th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students will dissect flowers to discover where seeds originate.
Directions: Teacher Information
Some plants produce two kinds of flowers on the same plant.  One will have only stamens, the other only pistils.  These are incomplete flowers.  There are also composite flowers (such as dandelions and marigolds) which consist of many complete flowers clustered into one.  The flowers used for this activity should have both stamens and a pistil, known as a complete flower.  These include flowers like the lily, gladiola, tulip, and fruit blossoms.  Select the largest flowers for this lesson and provide a variety of them.
Activity
Ask the students if they know how seeds are produced.  Tell them they are about to take a flower apart so they can see where seeds are formed.  If the students are too young to dissect flowers alone, do this activity as a demonstration.
Distribute data sheets, flowers, magnifiers, and clear tape to students and let them follow the data sheets as they dissect the flower.
Closure
Use the transparency How Flowers Reproduce (page 26) to explain the reproduction process to students.  Tell them bees are the best pollinators of flowers.  When a bee goes to a flower to get nectar and pollen, some pollen drops off the bee's body onto the sticky stigma on the pistil.  Beekeepers often rent hives to farms with apple orchards or other trees needing to be pollinated.  Other insects which visit flowers also pollinate them.  Pollen can also be transferred to the stigma by wind and by some birds and bats.
Explain that fruits and vegetables are really swollen ovaries of a blossom that grew on the plant.  Show students an apple and point out the leftover blossom and stem on opposite ends.  Cut the apple open to expose the seeds formed inside the ovary.  Let the students examine the seeds. 
Save the students' flower parts to be used in the next lesson and in the plant journal.
Extender
Take students on a walk to search for fruit-bearing plants that show blossoms and fruit.  Try to find examples of the transition from blossom to fruit on a plant.  Cut open a blossom to expose the swollen ovary inside, the beginning of the fruit.
Have students examine a dandelion flower and one which has gone to seed.  This is a great example of a composite flower.  Each seed is formed in its own flower but combined with others.

"Title: Chemical Magic
Grade Level: 3rd - 8th Grades
Description: Science
Objective: Students will use red cabbage juice as an indicator dye to identify acids and bases.
Directions: Follow the recipe below to make about a pint of cabbage indicator dye.
Red Cabbage Indicator Dye
Materials:  1/4 head red cabbage chopped into small pieces water, glass bowl, microwave 
Directions:  Chop the cabbage into small pieces and place them in the bowl. Add just enough water to cover the cabbage and bring it to a boil.  Boil for 3-4 minutes more.  Pour the contents into a strainer and drain off the liquid into a container.  Refrigerate until ready to use. 
Label the 6 oz. (178 mL) cups ""cabbage indicator dye"" and fill them about 1/2 full.  Place a dropper in each of these cups.
Pour the vinegar and ammonia into dropper bottles and label them. Give each group a set.  
(Note:  Ammonia can not be in an open container, due to the fumes. If droppers are used, fill the droppers 1/4 full, and give one to each group.)
Fill the test tubes 1/2 full with the dye and set them in the rack.  Optional:  Use inverted paper or Styrofoam cups with a hole in the bottom just large enough to hold the test tube.
Activity

Begin this lesson with a ""Magic Show"".  Place the test tubes with the dye in them where all students can see them.  Have ready a vial of pH paper with the color code, and a bottle of ammonia and vinegar with the label concealed. Tell the students you are going to perform a magic show that they are to watch and be ready to write an explanation of what they saw.  Follow the steps below.
    
Show the students the test tubes with the blue dye in it and have them note the color.
Into one of the tubes place three drops of vinegar and shake it.  Let the students observe the color changed from blue to pink (or red).
Drop three drops of ammonia into another tube and shake it.  Have the students observe that the color of the blue dye is now green.


Have each student write and draw what they think caused the color change.  When they finish this, discuss it with them.
Introduce the students to the pH paper and show them the color code inside the bottle.  Explain that this is a special paper which changes color to show if something is an acid or base.
    
Take one of the pH strips and place the lower half into the dye with no additives in it. Show the students the color change and hold the paper against the color code to match it.  Write the pH number on the board and show that it identifies this as a neutral substance.  Repeat this with the other test tubes, showing the dye with vinegar is acid and the ammonia a base. 


Provide each group with a cup of the dye, three 1 oz. (30 mL) cups, ammonia and vinegar bottles, and a copy of the data chart (page 43).  Have them use the dropper to fill the small cups just enough to cover the bottom of it.  Tell the students to follow the #1 chart and conduct the tests on the substances.  Explain that they should only use one or two drops of the vinegar and ammonia and then, record the results on the chart as they work.
Review the results the groups have recorded.  

Closure

Repeat the same tests, but this time provide students with a mystery liquid to test.  This should be either an acid or base made by adding a few drops of vinegar or ammonia to 1 oz. (30 mL) cup of water.  Do not provide the same mystery liquids to all groups so some will find it a base while others find it an acid.  
Students should use a dropper (or half of a straw) to transfer a few drops of the mystery liquid into the dye.  They may use the pH paper dipped into the mystery liquid to get its value.
After they have identified the mystery liquid as acid or base, reissue the dropper bottles of vinegar and ammonia to them.  Have them add drops of the opposite type of liquid to their mystery liquid and test it again.
Let them repeat this test again, but this time they use the dropper bottle with the matching acid or base as the mystery liquid was originally.  Note: The groups should use the same container of mystery liquid throughout these tests.  
Discuss their results, all will not be the same.  Let them see that as they add the opposite (base or acid) to their mystery liquid, it begins to approach neutral. 


Extenders

Let the students continue adding drops to the mystery liquid to achieve neutral if they can.  Their pH paper will be the best identifier for this test.
Send home the recipe for cabbage indicator dye along with a note to explain what the class has been doing.  Encourage the parents to make the dye with their children and repeat the tests, using household items such as tea, shampoo, crushed and liquefied Tums™.  Provide a time for the students to report their results to the class.

"Title: Calculating Discounts and Sales
Grade Level: 4th - 6th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Measurement (includes Time), Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.), Problem Solving
Objective: Students learn about decimal arithmetic and multiplication.
Directions: Facts to Know
You often hear commercials about savings at stores.  Sometimes, the announcer will say in the same breath, ""We're having our biggest sale of the year, and all items have been discounted by 30-50% off!""
Well, what's the difference between things being on sale and things being discounted?
Having a sale is the act of selling at lower prices than usual, as in ""Dorothy's House of Dresses is having a sale on skirts and jackets.""
A discount is used by manufacturers and merchants to mean taking off a certain percentage of the price given in a price list.  This price is called the list price.  The list price less the discount is known as the net price.  The noun ""discount"" can be used as a verb, too--""We're discounting by 15% the list price on all new cars and trucks during our storewide 'Get into Spring' sale!""
You can ask, ""What's the discount?"" but you would never ask, ""What's the sale?""
Often you have to figure out your own savings during a sale, and this is when an understanding of decimals and percents comes in handy.
Sample
A local carnival is offering a single, one-day pass to all rides for $12.50 or a special two-day pass for $20.00.  You do some quick decimal arithmetic.
Cost of 2 one-day passes
$12.50 x $2.82 = $25.00
2 one-day passes - special two-day pass
$25.00 - $20.00 = $5.00
So your savings on a two-day pass is $5.00.
But what percent off is that?
Cross Multiply
$5.00/$25.00 = x/100
25x = 500
x = 20 or 20% off

"Title: How to Work WIth Time Zones
Grade Level: 4th - 6th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Measurement (includes Time), Problem Solving
Objective: Students learn about time zones, and use their knowledge to solve math problems.
Directions: Distribute the Time Zone Map (page 16) to students to refer to as you introduce the topic of time zones.
Facts to Know
Time zones were established because, as the Earth rotates on its own axis, different places experience different times of the day, depending on the amount of sunlight that they are exposed to.  An international conference was held in 1884 to set up time zones.  The Greenwich Observatory in England was chosen as the starting point, and from this point, there would be 12 time zones to the east and 12 to the west.  Today, however, there are two half-hour time zones.  India, which spans two time zones, has chosen a single time midway between the two times.  When it is noon in London, for instance, it is 5:30 p.m. in central India.  The central part of Australia has a fractional time zone, too.
Each zone is one hour different from those on either side of it.  Across the oceans, the time zone borders run mostly north and south.  Across land, the borders follow political boundaries--the borders of nations and states, mainly.  There are six times zones total in the United States.  As you travel west, subtract one hour.  As you travel east, add one hour.
Distribute the activity pages to students and have them use what they have learned to complete the activity.

"Title: Search Engines
Grade Level: 4th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, Geography
Objective: understanding search engines
becoming familiar with Web site addresses
learning how to find valuable facts from the Internet
improving general Internet browsing skills
Directions: Students will launch the Internet and a search engine.  A search engine is similar to a card catalog in the library.  One can type their subject matter and find Internet sites about their topic.  There are several search engines, such as Alta Vista (http://www.altavista.com) or Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com).
Once the students have launched their search engines, have them type the country they are researching in the search box. 
You will then see how many sites met the search (often times the number will be well over 1,000).  Usually the best sites are in the first 25 or 30.
Students will find information on a city or country in Europe.  To find flight prices, your students may want to go directly to an airline Web site such as http://www.usair.com. 
Students will continue to find information about their city or country, such as popular foods, currency, weather, and fun facts.  Students may want to go to the Weather Channel (http://www.weather.com/) to find the weather for their European Country. 
Students should write the address of each website next to any fact included on the activity page.  Explain how important it is to cite where they found their information
Extension Ideas
European Internet research is great to do in conjunction with designing travel brochures.  One can also research almost any city or country around the world.  If students are doing state or country reports, require them to use at least two Internet sites as sources.

"Title: Life in Ancient Greece
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, Ancient History
Objective: Students get a ""feel"" for what it was like to live in ancient Greece.
Directions: For this activity, you will need to access Web Sites about life in Ancient Greece.  Links to these sites can be found at the following URL :http://www.teachercreated.com/books/2405
Click on page 77, sites 1, 2
 Teaching the Lesson:

The importance of ancient Greece to the development of modern civilization is well-documented.  However, less emphasis has been placed on the everyday life of Ancient Greek citizens.  One of the best ways of finding out about a culture is to read about their mythology and other fruits of their imagination.  Have students log on to the excellent sites above and explore the topic of their choice:




 The Place of the Home   
 Marriage and Death   


 The Role of Women    
 Games and Festivals   


 Clothing and Dress    
 Work and Slavery   


 Jewelry and Decoration   
 Greek Mythology    





Have students record their findings under the appropriate category on Activity Sheet G-1: Everyday Life in Ancient Greece and Activity Sheet G-2: Women in Ancient Greece.

 Extended Activities:
In spite of the fact that the Ancient Greeks and Romans were often at war with their neighbors, somehow they still found time to pursue artistic endeavors.  The Romans made beautiful mosaics on the floors and walls of their homes while the Greeks made exquisite pottery and sculptures.

Students can use keywords to search for the various types of Greek pottery until they find one design that could be used to make their own pottery.
Have students investigate Greek sculpture and Greek gods to find a piece of sculpture they can reproduce. Write up a title and description on a small index card to display with it.
Many of the descriptions and functions of the Roman gods and goddesses came directly from the Greek gods.  Ask students to choose one or two gods and verbally compare the Roman and Greek versions.

How to Meditate
You have probably heard the word ""meditation"" many times in your life. You may have seen pictures of people sitting in meditation with crossed legs and eyes closed. You may even know someone who meditates. But what exactly is meditation? What is its purpose? In all traditions of Buddhism, followers meditate in order to still their minds, to let go of the running thoughts inside their brains and purify it of greed, hatred, and ignorance. If you stop to notice, thoughts go on from the moment of waking until sleep. They even appear in dreams. For Buddhists, meditation is a means of finding what lies beyond these thoughts. Of course, this takes practice.
There are many forms of meditation. Usually, Buddhists sit still, spine straight and eyes closed. By focusing on their breath, they become more present, more aware of themselves. Although the stream of thoughts continues, the student simply watches them go by like clouds in the sky. Thus, he or she begins to be free of the grip of thinking.
Zen Buddhists have some unusual entries to meditation practices. One such entry is called a koan, or a riddle. The master asks a puzzling question which the student must answer correctly--although it may take days to comprehend! Thus, the koan provides the means for meditation.
Tibetan Buddhists like to focus on mandalas during meditation. Mandalas are elaborate designs rich with color and detail. They are often circular, containing either portraits of various gods or intricate patterns. After meditating on the mandala, the student will close his or her eyes and try to visualize the picture. Thus, the mind is disciplined while the heart merges with the spirit of the mandala.
Distribute the Mandalas activity sheet to students . Have them color the mandalas provided and then create their own. 
Extension
Have students try sitting quietly five minutes a day. Suggest that they just sit and listen to the sounds around them, even the sound of their breathing. After a few days, try ten minutes. Have them keep journals of their quiet time experiences.

"Title: Famous Olympians
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Social Studies, World History
Objective: Students learn about famous Olympic athletes.
Directions: If the names of famous Olympians were placed end to end, they could probably circle the globe many times. This activity provides an introduction to a few who earned the gold. Students may wish to read to find out more about them. It is hoped that they will continue their search to become acquainted with other equally famous Olympic Games stars.
U.S. Olympic Games Stars
In Athletics (track and field) events, the name of Jesse Owens, the sharecropper's son from Alabama, always tops the list of favorite Olympians. His four gold medals won at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games discredited Hitler's notion of German superiority over other races.
In 1984, another track sensation by the name of Carl Lewis matched Jesse Owens' performance of 28 years before and went on to excel in the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Games.
Babe Didrikson was the track star of the 1932 Olympic Games, capturing a gold medal for the U.S. in the javelin throw and another in the 800-meter hurdles. She went on to become a golf star and is still considered one of the most versatile female athletes.
The decathlon winner usually holds the honor of being considered the world's best athlete. In 1948, Bob Mathias became the youngest man to earn the gold. Four years later he won again at the age of 21. Other honored decathlon winners include Rafer Johnson (1960), Bill Toomey (1968), Bruce Jenner (1976), and Dan O'Brien (1996).
Swimming and diving have seen their champions, too. After winning five gold medals in swimming in 1924 and 1928, Johnny Weissmuller went on to play the original Tarzan. Patricia McCormick practiced over 100 dives a day to achieve her goal. She swept the diving events for the United States in both the 1956 and 1960 Olympic Games. Her daughter also went on to medal in diving in the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Games. 
Greg Louganis, protégé of the 1948 Olympic Games diving star Dr. Sammy Lee, began his Olympic diving carreer in 1976, winning the silver medal on platform at the age of 16. Louganis won gold medals in the 1984 and 1988 Games. After winning two bronze medals in 1968, Mark Spitz came back to earn seven gold medals in swimming events in the l972 Olympic Games in Munich.
Eddie Eagan won a gold medal in boxing in 1920 and another in four-man bobsledding in 1932. He is the only athlete to have won a gold medal in both the Olympic Games and the Olympic Winter Games.
In 1980, speed skater Eric Heiden became the first to win five individual gold medals in his sport. Speed skater Bonnie Blair won five gold medals between 1988 and 1994.
The sport of figure skating has brought the gold to the U.S. quite often. Winners include Tenley Albright (1956), Carol Heiss (1960), Peggy Fleming (1968), Dorothy Hamill (1976), Kristy Yamaguchi (1992), and Tara Lipinski (1998). Dick Button was a two-time gold medal winner for the men (1948 and 1952) and continued to participate in many Olympic Games as a television commentator on his sport. Hayes Alan Jenkins won a skating gold in 1956, and his brother David took it in 1960. Other men's winners include Scott Hamilton (1984) and Brian Boitano (1988).
Some of the most familiar names among past U.S. Olympians are found in the boxing world. Floyd Patterson won the gold for the United States in the 1952 Games and later became the heavyweight champion of the world. George Foreman won the gold in the super heavyweight division in 1968. As a professional, he defeated the 1964 winner, Joe Frazier. Later he lost to the gold medal winner of the 1960 Games, Cassius Clay, known to boxing fans as Muhammad Ali.
Other famous U.S. Olympians include:
Andrea Mead Lawrence of Vermont who was the first U.S. woman to win two medals in Alpine skiing.
Harrison ""Bones"" Dillard who was considered one of the greatest hurdlers of all times. He won four gold medals for the U.S. in 1948 and 1952.
Al Oerter who threw the discus to win the gold in four Olympic Games (1956-1968).
Parry O'Brian who threw the shot put in four Olympic Games (1952-1964) for two gold medals and a silver medal.
Foreign Stars 
Leonidas of Rhodes, perhaps the greatest runner of all time, won the 200- meter, 400- meter, and hoplite in four Olympic Games from 164 b.c. to 152 b.c.
Paavo Nurmi, known as the ""flying Finn,"" first competed in 1920. He won seven gold and three silver medals for Finland over three Olympic Games. He was known for his explosive starts and habit of boasting ahead of time about his winning performances.
Daley Thompson of Great Britain became the pride of his country by winning the decathlon in 1980 and 1984.
Dawn Fraser, Australia's popular freestyle swimmer, competed in three successive Olympic Games (1956, 1960, and 1964). She earned one silver and five gold medals.
Sonja Henie of Norway was only 11 years old when she appeared in her first Olympic Games in 1924. She did not win that year, but she later won three gold medals in figure skating (1928, 1932, and 1936). After her figure skating career she became a popular movie star. 
In 1956, Anton (Tony) Sailer became the hero of Austria as the first skier to sweep gold medals in all three Alpine events.
In 1968, Jean Claude Killy of France succeeded in repeating Sailer's feat. In 1992, he was once again in the spotlight as he secured and organized the Games for Albertville, France. These Games took place in the Alpine mountains only a few miles from where Killy had grown up and first learned to ski.
The West Germans were hoping for the same three Alpine medals in 1976 from their skiing sensation, Rosi Mittermaier. She won the first two races but lost the Giant Slalom by only .12 of a second.
The beginning of the gymnastic craze is often credited to 17-year-old Olga Korbut of the Soviet Union, but she did not win a gold medal in individual event competition. Her aggressive and daring style amazed the fans at the 1972 Games. Four years later, Nadia Comaneci of Romania collected seven perfect tens, the highest score in gymnastics. Nadia won three gold medals in Montreal in 1976 and two in Moscow in 1980.
The continent of Africa has been the home of many brilliant runners. Abebe Bikila, used to running barefoot in his native Ethiopia, saw no reason to put on shoes as he ran the marathon in the 1960 Olympic Games. After winning the gold medal in two hours and 15 minutes, he still had enough energy to take a victory lap around the stadium. In 1964, he again won the marathon, this time wearing shoes. He is the only man in Olympic Games history to win two consecutive marathons.
Runner Kipchoge Keino of Kenya won two gold and two silver medals over two Olympic Games (1968 and 1972). He wore a cap when he raced and delighted in tossing it to the crowd as he completed his final lap.
Distribute the activity sheet to students and have them use their newfound knowledge of Olympic athletes to complete the page.

"Title: Simulation: Feudal Candy
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, Ancient History, World History
Objective: Students will identify the order of societal rank and loyalties within feudal Europe.
Directions: Preparation
Reproduce and cut out the role identification cards on page 38 in the following class percentages (approximate): Noble (10%); Vassal (30%); Peasant (55%). Prepare only one King identification card since there will be only one student in this role at any given time. For example, in a class of 21 students, roles could be assigned as follows: 1 King, 2 Nobles, 6 Vassals, and 12 Peasants. (See diagram on page 39.)
The Noble, Vassal, and Peasant cards need to be categorized into two respective domains: one-half of each are to be marked A, and the other half are to be labeled with a B.  If you have a third noble, the role cards would be divided into thirds.  Depending upon the number of students, you may have to alter the number of cards slightly to keep the approximate proportions.
Throughout the activity there can be only one king. The ratio of total students in the class to nobles should be about 10 to 1.
Make a transparency of a Feudal Classroom that represents your students. Use the sample diagram on page 39 as a guide.
Procedure
Have students draw identification role cards at random.
Then, depending on whether they belong to the realm of Noble A or that of Noble B, students should arrange their desks similar to the diagram on page 39, which the teacher should place on the overhead projector. (If an overhead projector is not available, simply reproduce the diagram onto a chart or copy it on the chalkboard.)
Arrange the room to approximate the diagram. (Availability of space will dictate the room arrangement and necessary modifications.)
Give each student or member of the realm a paper cup containing ten M&M's. The nobles and vassals should also be given a plastic spoon or a glove. The candy is to represent the harvest reaped in a particular year by the peasants.
Since the peasants were paying for their protection with their crops, have the vassals confiscate six M&M's from each peasant using their spoons or rubber gloves. (The lines on the diagram indicate the number of peasants to each vassal.)
From each peasant's payment, the vassal is to keep one piece and give five to his lord, the noble.
From each vassal's payment of fidelity, or loyalty, the noble is to keep two pieces and give three candies to the king (once again using the spoon or glove).
Using the classroom arrangement on page 39 and the procedures above, the final candy distribution might look like this: the peasants, 4 candies; the vassals, 12 candies; the nobles, 22 candies; the king, a lusty 46 candies.
For Discussion
In the early medieval period, the rights of man were not a major concern; survival was.  At the end of this activity, students will no doubt complain that the king now has 46 pieces of candy while they, as peasants, have but four.  Turn those concerns into constructive and informative discussions about the roles within and aspects of the feudal system by asking the following questions:  What need would the nobles and king have for all that food and material?  What choice did the peasants have?  Why did feudalism work?

, paper cups (one for each student), 
, plastic spoons or surgical latex gloves (enough for each noble and vassal), 
, one 8-ounce (224 g) bag of M&M's,

"Title: Internet Activity: Temperature Highs and Lows
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Data Analysis and Probability, Science, Earth and Space Science, Social Studies, Geography
Objective: In this activity students will:  develop a data-gathering strategy involving multiple sources; accurately record and graph information gathered from multiple sources; and use information to predict temperature patterns in a variety of locations.
Directions: Description
This activity could be a part of a larger unit on weather or on graphing.  Using e-mail, students will collect the high and low temperature readings from a variety of locations.  By using e-mail as opposed to online or print sources, students can also explore differences in microclimates within their own region.  They will plot the locations on a map.  Using the information they have gathered, students will look for patterns and will predict future temperatures.  
Procedure

Be sure that students have an outdoor thermometer that is easily accessible from the classroom.  Prepare a class-size chart like the one on page 75 on which the students can record your local temperatures.
Have students record the temperatures each day at the opening bell, at lunch, and at the end of the school day.  Keep this record for five to seven days.
Post these results on a board or chart.  At the end of the week, ask students what they notice.  Accept all conclusions.
Have the class use the Internet to help them collect other temperature data.  Explain that it will be easier to explore variations in temperature if you have a wider group of samples.  Ask students how they might accomplish this.  Also discuss whether the collection method used in your class would be effective in collecting data from others.  If you wish, they can record their data on the chart (page 75).
Compile a list of information sources, using either locally generated contacts or a Web site like ePals.
    http://www.epals.com
    Create a time line for completing the project.  Determine how the data will be entered.  A spreadsheet is a useful tool.  Who will do this data entry?
Create an e-mail message explaining your project and generate a reporting form to standardize data collection (see the sample on the next page).  If you send the form as an attachment, participants can respond more easily.
Gather your data.  Perhaps a group of students can be responsible for managing information from each remote site.
At the close of the data gathering phase, have each student group report on their data.  Ask that they include numerical and graphical reports.  This project lends itself to real-time work with mean, median, range, etc.  What conclusions has each group drawn from the data?  What conclusions can the class as a whole draw from the data?
Use chat or Instant Messaging to share information among participants.

Assessment
Students can be graded on the presentation and analysis of data and the level of participation for students within a group.

, map(s), 
, e-mail addresses for participants, 
, software programs for creating/using e-mail, spreadsheet, and word processor documents,

"Title: Icon Adoration:  The Byzantine Empire
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, Ancient History
Objective: Students will recognize icon worship as one source of division between the early Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church of the Byzantine Empire.
Directions: Preparation
Make an overhead transparency of each of the pictographs on the accompanying sheets.
Procedure

While engaged in the study of a unit on the Byzantine Empire, surprise students at the beginning of the class period with the announcement of a ""pop"" quiz.  They need to get out a sheet of paper and number it one to five.
The quiz will consist of each of the five pictograph transparencies that students will try to identify by correctly naming them on their papers.
When the last of the pictographs has been displayed, collect the quizzes.  Then survey students as to their opinions of the quiz:  What did you like about the quiz?  What was unusual about the quiz format?  Did you think it was fair?  Would you like future quizzes like this one if they weren't surprise quizzes?
The intent of the previous questions is to hopefully engender a discussion where the class presents diverse points of view regarding the quiz's symbolic nature.  Those students who are more visual learners may have liked to take the pictographs quiz.  Other students may very well have resented being evaluated on the basis of symbols they did not create or that had not been previously reviewed.
Assure students that the quiz will not count as a grade.  Rather, use the simulation as an introduction for a lesson on one of the divisions that developed between the Church of the Western Roman Empire (Roman Catholic) and the Church of the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire (Greek Orthodox).  (See background information below.)

Background
In the eighth century A.D., many Christians in the former Roman Empire used icons, or religious images, to assist in their worship services.  In the Byzantine Empire (the eastern half of the former Roman Empire centered in Constantinople), disagreements developed as to whether or not icons broke the second commandment which prohibited the making of graven images.
While the emperor of the Byzantine Empire tried to wrestle his people away from icon worship, the leaders of the Roman Church in Italy became upset with the Byzantines.  Since most people in Western Europe at this time could not read, icons were valuable assets in teaching Christianity.  The Pope and other church leaders in Rome summarily dismissed the Byzantine emperor from the Christian church.
Even though the Byzantine emperor eventually allowed his people to keep icons in their worship, the rift that originated between the eastern and western branches of Christianity over icon worship grew wider and wider with each century.  By the middle of the eleventh century, the Roman Catholic Church and the Greek Orthodox Church were completely separate entities.
Extension
Pictographs can be a unique way for students to visualize the meanings of various terms.  Having students create their own pictographs and sharing them with classmates is a refreshingly different way to review vocabulary.
Resources: 
, the accompanying Icon Adoration Symbols sheets (see the link to the activity pages below), 
, an overhead and transparencies for each of the pictographs,

"Title: Zapped! (Non-Verbal Communication Game)
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts
Objective: Students learn about non-verbal communication.
Directions: This is a game for any age group.  The point of the game is to communicate without speaking.
Teacher Instructions:  Prepare squares of folded paper, one for each participant.  Place a dot on one of the squares; leave the other squares blank.  Cut out the squares and then fold each of them so that no one can see the dot.  Place the squares in a container and have each participant draw one.  The person who draws the dot is the zapper.  He or she should tell no one.
Rules of the Game

Each player--including the zapper--receives a form (page 87).  The object is to, without speaking, get a different person to sign each line of the form.  (Players may allow someone to sign more than one line if everyone else has signed and there are still blank lines left.)
The zapper must attempt to zap people by winking at an individual without drawing the attention of the other players.  If he winks at everyone before he is discovered, he wins the game.
When someone is winked at, they are out of the game.  They may no longer try to complete their form.  Also, they may not reveal the identity of the zapper to those still in the game.
The game may also be won by contestants who complete the form before everyone is zapped.  Just announce you are the winner when the form is completed.  Do not speak until that point!
Another way to win the game is to announce correctly who the zapper is.  This cannot be done when he has zapped you.  You must observe him zapping someone else.  If you proclaim someone the zapper and are incorrect, you are out of the game.
Anyone who speaks for any reason other than those previously mentioned is disqualified from the game.

"Title: The Story of Kwanzaa
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students will learn about the history and traditions of Kwanzaa.
Directions: Background Information
Kwanzaa (pronounced Kwahn-zaah) is a relatively new holiday, begun in 1966 by an African American named Maulana Ron Karenga, a professor of Black Studies at the California State University at Long Beach.  Celebrated from December 26 through January 1, Kwanzaa is a time when people of African descent can honor the customs of their ancestors.
In the Swahili language, the word kwanzaa means ""first.""  The holiday received its name because in Africa so many tribes celebrated the first harvest of their crops each year.  The celebration dates were chosen to correspond with the African harvest festivals, usually held in late December and early January.
Kwanzaa is not a religious or political holiday.  It is a cultural celebration based on seven principles which serve as a guide for daily living, and which came from family beliefs in many parts of Africa.  The seven principles are referred to as the Nguzo Saba (en-goo-zo sah-bah).  The seven principles are:  Unity, Self-Determination, Collective Work and Responsibility, Cooperative Economics, Purpose, Creativity, and Faith.  The activity sheets attached are bulletin board patterns for the seven principles.
During Kwanzaa, a special candleholder called a kinara is lit each evening to celebrate one of the seven principles.  This kinara is symbolic of the family's African ancestors.  As a candle is lit, the family talks about the special meaning of the day.  The candles are only part of the holiday.  Family and friends enjoy special foods, such as fruits and vegetables, and small homemade gifts are exchanged.  A karamu, or feast, is held on the last day with music and dancing.
Activity Description
The Arabs call this game Kalah.  They brought it to Africa where it has many different names.  In East Africa it is called Mankala.  In West Africa, it is called Owara.  In South Africa it is known as Ohora.
You can make this game out of an empty egg carton.  The end sections are the Kalahs.  Each player's Kalah is on his or her right.  These sections count as cups during the game.
Activity Directions
Build the game board by separating the top and bottom of the egg carton.  Cut the top section in half and affix each half to the side of the bottom section (be sure you put the top with the flat part down so that it forms cups at the ends of the egg carton).
Play starts when the players put three beans into each of the small cups on their own sides.
The first player begins by taking all of the beans out of one of his or her cups and moving to the right, dropping one bean into each of the next three cups.  Remember, the Kalah counts as a cup after play begins.
If the first player is able to drop the bean into his or her own Kalah, he/she gets another turn.  If the last (third) bean does not end up in his/her own Kalah, it becomes the other player's turn.
Each player continues to take turns trying to get as many beans as possible into his/her own Kalah, until all the cups on one player's side are empty.
The winner is the player with the most beans in his/her Kalah.

"Title: Simulation: Urban Planning for an Ancient Mayan City
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Oral Language, Listening, Speaking, Social Studies, Ancient History
Objective: Students will describe and explain the significance of the building plan of a Mayan city.
Directions: Preparation

Make enough copies of the cards to allow for two Priests, Nobles, Artisans, and Merchants each.  The remainder of the class should receive cards marked Peasants.  You may wish to use heavy stock that can be laminated so that cards may be held for future use.
Using an overhead transparency or the chalkboard, recreate the seating diagram so students can easily position themselves according to its layout.

Procedure

Use the sample diagram to reposition the desks in your room before the students arrive for the start of the day.  (Note: The sample is set to a standard rectangular room formation; feel free to improvise the seating to meet your individual room configuration.  It is only necessary to maintain the concentric effect of Priests/Nobles in the center followed by an outer ring of Artisans/Merchants with Peasants on the exterior fringes).
As students enter the classroom, randomly dispense the role cards one by one.
Instruct students to view the seating diagram and sit in any position that corresponds to their specific role cards.

    (Note: You should be sure to collect the role cards once all students have been properly seated.  This is especially important if you teach in a departmentalized format where several classes will enter your room throughout the course of a day.)

Before the instructor proceeds with the day's lesson about the Mayan civilization, he or she should inform the students that the peculiar seating arrangement represents the layout of a typical Mayan city.  The teacher may ask students to offer conjecture as to the significance of this residential pattern.  (See Background, page 87.)  Depending upon the content of previous lessons, students may readily offer an accurate explanation, or they may just hypothesize if ""Urban Planning"" is being used as an anticipatory set for information that is to be initially presented on that day.

Background
The Mayan civilization of southern Mexico and northern Central America (Guatemala, Belize) reached its height between the third and tenth centuries, A.D.  Its cities were focal points of religious celebrations involving pyramid-style temples and the worship of numerous gods.  Government was conducted and priests and rulers lived in these communities as well.
To that end, the hub of a Mayan city was its temple with priests residing close by.  Since nobility ruled, ruling families also lived close to the city's center.  With declining status, people lived farther away from the core of the city.  Wealthy artisans and merchants resided farther out than the ruling classes, yet they were much closer than the multitude of peasants.  They were farthest removed as they took care of the fields on the perimeter of a city.
Once again, ""Urban Planning"" takes some flexibility on the part of the teacher.  For a day, it offers a bit of variety to the class(es) as it attempts to illuminate one aspect of life in a once dominant civilization.

"Title: Secret Message
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students learn about a woman war hero who used secret codes and messages to protect important information.  They follow instructions to write their own secret messages.
Directions: Lead a class discussion to find out what students know about World War II.  They may have seen films of soldiers parachuting into battle.  Tell them that one of the persons to parachute into a country and carry valuable information was a woman.
Hannah Senesh was a member of the Jewish faith during a time when Jews were being prosecuted.  She lived in Palestine, which was safe for Jewish people, but her mother lived in Hungary.  If the German Nazis took over Hungary, Hannah knew that her mother and many other Jews who lived there would be in danger of being killed.  Hannah and four Jewish men parachuted into Yugoslavia.  They were going to deliver supplies and secret messages, take back war information to the English, and try to help some of the Jews escape from the Nazis in Hungary. 
When Hannah had almost reached the border of Hungary, she was captured by Nazi soldiers.  Hannah was carrying secret papers from the English, a radio for sending messages, and a secret code which she had memorized.  Hannah knew that she would be questioned because of these items, but she resolved not to tell what she knew.
Hannah was tortured.  Her teeth were knocked out.  The soldiers forced her mother to watch them beat her.  But Hannah did not tell the secrets.  She would not betray the English soldiers or her Jewish friends and family.  She was kept in prison for two months.  In November, 1944, she was taken to the yard to be shot.
Twenty-three-year-old Hannah refused to be blindfolded.  She faced those with rifles as she had faced life, pain, and duty--bravely, squarely, and without shame.  Hannah kept her secrets and her pride.

"Title: The Gettysburg Address
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students learn about Abraham Lincoln and the Gettysburg address in honor of Presidents' Day.
Directions: Give students some background information about Abraham Lincoln:
Presidential Term (1861-1865)
16th President
Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in the backwoods of Kentucky.  When he was seven years old, his family moved to southwest Indiana where Lincoln helped to clear the fields and plant crops.  His mother died when he was nine years old and his father remarried about a year later.  He got along well with his stepmother and her three children.  The family made another move to Illinois in 1830.  Abraham was 21 years old and six feet four inches tall.  He was muscular and physically powerful.   
Abraham once said he went to school by ""the littles""--a little now and a little then.   He enjoyed reading and was a self-taught prairie lawyer.  His political future began to take shape with his successful legal career in Springfield, Illinois.  He ran for public office several times and served in the Illinois legislature and as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.
He married Mary Todd on November 4, 1842.  They had four children, Robert (the only one who lived to adulthood), Edward, William, and Thomas (""Tad"").
In 1858 he was the Republican candidate for the Senate.  Though he was not an abolitionist, he was morally against slavery, a practice he had seen years before while visiting New Orleans. He ran against Stephen Douglas, and though he did not win, their debates made him famous.   He was devoted to the cause of personal freedom for all people.
In 1860 Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States.  As expected, the Southern (slave) states withdrew from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America.  He led the North through the Civil War and wrote the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing the slaves.  At Gettysburg, he gave one of his most famous speeches, declaring that government ""of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."" 
The war ended just as he was beginning his second term as president.  He was planning the reconstruction of the United States.  Within days of his second inauguration, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth.  He died early on the morning of April 15, 1865.
Extension Activities

Lincoln was born in Kentucky.  He moved to Indiana at age seven.  At 17 he built a flatboat and ran farm products down the Mississippi River to New Orleans.  He married Mary Todd at her sister's home in Springfield, Illinois.  He was named the Republican presidential candidate in Chicago, Illinois, and delivered his most famous speech at the battlefield cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  He was assassinated at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C.  Locate and label these locations on a map of the United States.
Lincoln was more interested in preserving the Union than ending slavery.  Discuss the arguments for and against secession.
Make a list of words that describe Abraham Lincoln, his appearance and personality.  Organize them into a character sketch.
Read more information about the Confederacy and the Union.  What were the strengths and weaknesses of each group?  Make a chart to show what you learn.  Compare the advantages of the North and South.  Which group do you think seemed likely to win? 
Do research to learn the major battles of the Civil War.  Locate and label them on a map of the United States.  Indicate which side was victorious in each. 
As a result of the war, Clara Barton founded the American Red Cross to help people in need.  What duties do women perform (then and now) in time of war?  How does the Red Cross respond to disasters today?  What can you do to contribute to the organization?

"Title: Simulation: The King's Candy
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Oral Language, Listening, Speaking, Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students explain why Americans were upset with British tax laws, such as the Stamp Act, after the French and Indian war.  They will also identify two tactics colonials used to demonstrate their displeasure with these taxes.
Directions: Prepare the Role Cards as directed on the pages.

Cut out the Object Cards.  Label the six cards with names of items commonly worn or possessed by students in class--e.g., jeans, running shoes, glasses, pens, jewelry.  You do not need to use all six cards; three to six cards seem to work well for this simulation.  In the corner box of each of the object cards, write a number ranging from one to three.  As will be explained later, these numbers will represent a taxable value.

At the start of class give each student a paper cup containing ten candies.  Instruct students not to touch the candies.Randomly pass out the Role Cards to students.  Explain that those possessing King, Parliament, and Tax Collector cards should proceed to the front of the room.  The king should take a designated seat of honor, and the members of Parliament should also have a specific area from which they will enact their roles.Members of Parliament (those students possessing Parliament Role Cards) will draw from your previously compiled and prepared group of Object Cards.  Parliament members announce to the Colonists what item is to be taxed (e.g., blue jeans), and anyone possessing that item will have to pay out the number of candies equal to the number written on the Object Card.  So if the card marked blue jeans-3 is pulled, each colonist wearing blue jeans would relinquish three candies. Those students possessing Tax Collector role cards do all of the collecting using plastic spoons or gloves and all taxes (candies) are returned to Parliament.  (Each tax collector has charge over half the room,)  Taxes should be levied for at least three items but not more than six.  If you have a good idea of what is popular in student dress, four items seems to be an optimum number for successfully relieving several students of all their candy and leaving many more with just one or two of their original total.

After all taxes have been levied, these funds are to be dispersed.  The tax collectors each reap ten percent of the take.  Parliament receives fifty percent (these funds are to be used to run the empire) to be split equally among the two students in that role.  Finally, King George pockets the remaining forty percent for himself.  (These percentages have no real historical significance and are only an arbitrary breakdown for purposes to fit this simulation.)  It is quite possible that while some students will have had all of their  candies confiscated, members of Parliament and the king will have upwards of thirty to forty pieces each to show for their efforts.

Some students may show definite feelings of displeasure just as some on the receiving end of this taxing generosity may gloat just a bit too much.  The objective for this lesson should be completed during the withdrawl from the roles. Understanding how the colonists reacted to the tax collectors and the various tax laws from the Stamp Act and beyond will be relevant to the class at this crucial moment.  Discuss the following 

questions:

 What was so unfair about how the class was taxed?
How could it have been handled more fairly?
Why were tax collectors tarred and feathered?
What methods and organizations were devised by the colonists in order to resist and circumvent these laws?
How significant were these laws to the ultimate break of Great Britain?


The frustration that the students feel with the unfairness of the way they lost their candy can be easily compared to the substantial give and take on one of the central issues leading to revolution--taxation without representation.

, one 8-ounce (224 grams) bag of candy, 
, Role Cards and Object Cards, reproduced on index paper or heavy stock, 
, one small paper cup for each student,

"Title: Mapping World War II
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, United States History, Geography
Objective: Students map World War II in honor of Memorial Day.
Directions: World War II presents itself with a number of possible mapping activities.  Some suggested projects are listed below.  Use the maps on page 226 or have the students draw their own maps as specified.  Pair or group the students and assign each a different mapping activity.  When all projects have been completed let one group at a time share their assignments with the rest of the class.  Compile all the maps into a classroom book about World War II. 

Use a map of Europe.  Title the map ""German and Italian Aggression in Europe in 1939.""  Color all the German-invaded countries red; label each country with its correct name.  Color the Italian-invaded countries green; label each country with its name. 
On a map of the Pacific region, color red all the countries which were Japanese territories in 1941.  Label each country with its name.  Give the map an appropriate title.
Map the European theater war battles.  Draw a symbol of your choice to show where battles took place, for example, Dunkirk, Nunzio, and Kursk.  Label each city with its name.  On the back of the map, list each city and tell who fought there and who won. 
Use a map of Europe to show which countries were Allied forces, which were Axis powers, and which remained neutral.  Color all Allied countries blue, color all Axis countries red and leave all neutral countries white.  Label each country with its name. 
Draw a map of the island of Oahu.  Locate and label the following military installations: Hickam Field, Wheeler Field, Pearl Harbor, Bellows Field, Barbers Point Marine Base, Haleiwa Field, and Kaneohe Naval Air Station.  Draw appropriate symbols, such as planes, to indicate the path taken by the Japanese forces and the damage done to U.S. forces.  Make a list of all the U.S. Navy ships which were sunk or damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
Make a map which reflects the changes in boundaries of European countries after World War II.  Label each country.  Make a list of those that were newly created and another list of those that were eliminated.  
Map the Battle of the Bulge, the D-Day invasion, or the Battle of Britain.  Draw different symbols for each set of forces.  Label the cities in which the battles were fought.  Use arrows to show the directions in which the various forces moved.
Draw a map of Germany; copy it.  Label one map ""Pre World War II.""  Label the other map ""Post-World War II.""  Show the differences in internal boundaries between the two time periods.

"Title: Simulation: Norse Scratchings
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, Ancient History
Objective: Students identify Norse letters as runes and decode a simple runic message.
Directions: Preparation

Make several copies of Norse Runes.  (The exact number of letters needed depends on how a teacher will use them in class.  See Procedure, step 3.)
Cut out each rune (with its English letter translation) and place the individual runes in a paper bag or shoebox.
On the drawing paper, create a simple message using the runes that would possibly serve as a source of motivation for students.  (e.g., ""Whoever reads this gets five bonus points."" or ""Find the treasure for you in the box under the table in the back of the room."")
Overlap the paper onto the lower end of the coat hanger and secure it with tape.

Procedure

A week before you begin a unit on the Vikings, hang the runic message in a prominent position in the classroom where each student can easily view it.  (If you really want it to be obvious, use larger paper and colored markers.)  The instructor should defer any questions about the strange markings until he or she is ready to present a lesson on Viking runes.  However, as interest is aroused, have students hypothesize what the symbols may represent.
When the unit on the Vikings begins, tell the class that periodically you will be distributing letter codes that will be useful in decoding the strange message that has been hanging in the classroom for the past week.  Explain that whoever is first to decode the message will be pleasantly surprised.
Letter translations should be chosen at random by a simple draw from the shoebox or grocery bag.  These individual letter decoders may be given away to individual students who answer a question correctly in class, to any student who completes a homework assignment, to a cooperative team that answers correctly in a review format, or for any other circumstance the classroom teacher wishes to use.
The first student to turn in the exact message on a piece of paper to the teacher will be deemed the winner.

Background
The Norse alphabet, or Futhark as it was called, was a series of 23 straight-lined symbols the Vikings employed as an alphabet.  They were straight lines because the Vikings carved them into stone or wood, and curved lines would have been difficult.  Viking runes were the source for spells and charms, as well as simple, everyday messages.
Viking sagas, or legendary stories, were not written down in this script.  They were oral traditions that only ended up on paper several hundred years after the apex of Viking culture.  When they were written down, they were written in Latin. 
Extension

Have interested students research the Kensington Stone, a stone with apparent runic carvings on it unearthed in Kensington, Minnesota, in 1898.  Its authenticity is the source of great debate among Norse scholars.
Give students individual copies of the Futhark and have them make simple messages.

, the accompanying sheet of Norse Runes (page 42), 
, a 12"" x 18"" (30 cm x 46 cm) sheet of tagboard or drawing paper,

"Title: Rebus Treasure
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, Ancient History
Objective: Students solve a rebus puzzle in order to find a hidden treasure.  This can be used as an anticipatory set designed to lead into the discussion of ancient written languages, whether from Neanderthal pictographs or Egyptian hieroglyphics.  It does an effective job of focusing students on the idea that early civilizations often utilized concrete images for symbols representing sounds and/or ideas.
Directions: Before class time, make copies of one of the Rebus activity sheets or create one tailored to your classroom.  Choose a rebus based on where you intend to hide the incentive.  Obtain the student incentive.
Divide the class into cooperative learning teams.  Provide each student with a copy of the rebus.  Groups should be given a specific time limit to decipher the puzzle, usually no more than five minutes.
Since it is possible that more than one group could solve the rebus in the time allowed, plan a rational method for choosing a team for the original search attempt.  A random draw of team names from a hat could be one method used to break a tie.  A less arbitrary measure would be to allow the first opportunity to solve the rebus to the team that most closely follows a specified set of directions and has completed the solution.
An alternative would be to move around the classroom garnering the responses from each team within the specified time allotment.  In this situation, the first team to whisper the correct answer to the puzzle would subsequently gain access to the treasure hunt.  The teacher should note successive completion times of other teams should that become necessary in the next step.
The selected learning group will then have a short period of time (about one minute) to locate the prize.  If the group cannot find the treasure within the minute, the second ranked team would be offered a sixty-second quest.  This rotation would be followed until either the prize was found or every team was given the opportunity to look.
As a follow-up activity, encourage students to create their own symbolic alphabets, employing various geometric or pictographic designs.
Resources: 
, Rebus activity sheets, 
, a teacher-selected treasure that will serve as an incentive for the students (e.g., pack of gum, pieces of fruit, pencils, erasers, stickers, etc.).  There should be an adequate amount to share among the members of the largest student learning team.,

"Title: Simulation: Yum Yum Trees - Conservation of Resources
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science, Social Studies
Objective: Students devise at least one possible solution to the problem-solving presented in this lesson.  They will name at least three renewable and three non-renewable natural resources that are subjects of contemporary conservation measures.
Directions: Divide the class into cooperative learning teams.  Ask each team to choose a representative or spokesperson.
Pass out copies of The Yum-Yum Tree Dilemma and Yum-Yum Territory Map to each student.  Orally review the dilemma with them as they read silently to themselves.
Have teams convene in a brainstorming session for three to five minutes.  All possible ideas for solving the dilemma should be presented by team members without censorship.
During a subsequent three- to five-minute session, teams should begin to eliminate those solutions with unfavorable consequences for the Ube tribe.  Using general consensus, each team should settle upon what they believe to be their single best solution to share with the class.
Each spokesperson should share his or her team's solution with the class and field questions from classmates and/or the instructor.  Any idea should be accepted if there is evidence of critical thinking in the team's decision-making process.
After all teams have shared their suggestions, conduct a discussion regarding the question of what might have caused the extinction of the Ube's yum-yums.  While some students may suggest natural causes for the extinction of the yum-yum trees, others will undoubtedly bring up the point that the tribe over-harvested the trees without regard to eventual consequences.  Make a connection between this observation and similar damage which has occurred in the world's present environment.  Other questions to ask might include, What possible cost did the Ubes face because of an error in conservation?  Are there any lessons in the dilemma of the Ubes that pertain to society today?
Next, discuss the meaning of renewable and non-renewable natural resources.  Give some examples of each to stimulate thought, then have teams or individual students make a list of renewable and/or non-renewable resouces that are the subject of conservation measures in the local, national, or global community.
This problem-solving activity presents several topics for investigation.  While there are no definite right or wrong answers for this dilemma, certain solutions have more potential than others.  For example, the Ubes may decide that it's better to send small bands of people to obtain yum-yums, or that seeds might be brought back from the excursion instead of entire trees.  However, all student-generated solutions should be considered.  Whatever solutions are generated, be sure to use the activity to discuss not only how geography determines how people live, but how contemporary people have risked their future by showing an uncontrollable appetite for natural resources.

"Title: Simulation: River Cruise:  Rivers of the World
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, Geography
Objective: Students will identify major rivers of the world by the location of their sources, their mouths, and/or other significant details of their courses.
Directions: Background 
River Cruise not only reviews information about rivers, it invites students to tune their listening skills as clues are read aloud only once.  You may encourage team members to take notes in order to maintain possession of clues throughout the competition.

On the game board, space is provided for checking off each clue given for a river.  When the river is identified, circle the appropriate point value and record the name of the team which first recognized it.  When changing levels, leave the circled scores for each river at the previous level of play, noting the team that garnered the points.  Erase the clue number notations and team record in order to initiate a different level of play.

Preparation

Reproduce copies of the clue sheets and cut out the individual river cruise tickets.  Keep related cards together but place them in random order.
Prepare an overhead transparency of the River Cruise game board.
Obtain and ready an overhead projector.

Procedure

Divide the class into heterogeneous cooperative learning teams.
Tell students that they will be playing a game that allows review of the major rivers of the world.  You will read a clue about a famous river, and each team in turn will try to identify its name.
There are three levels of play during each game, determined by the degree of difficulty involved in identifying that particular set of rivers by its clues.  The levels are 'Still Water' (easy), 'Swift Current' (average), and 'White Water Rapids' (challenging).  For each level of play, the teacher presents the overhead transparency of the game board with six unknown rivers labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F, corresponding to the labels on the cruise tickets.  There are four clues for each of the six rivers.
Teams orally choose a clue for any of the six rivers by calling out  a letter A-F.  During the 'Still Water' level of play, a river identified on the first clue given is worth 40 points.  Guessing the name of a river correctly on the second clue garners 30 points; on the third clue, 20 points; and on the fourth clue, 10 points.  The point values change with each level of play.
Note that tickets for the Still Water Cruise (easy level) have already been provided.  You may wish to prepare additional sets of four clues each for Swift Current (average) and White Water Rapids (challenging) levels.  (Some teachers may involve student teams in researching and developing the clues.)  Simply block out the clues on an existing set of tickets and reproduce blank tickets for the next level of difficulty.  The new clues may be written directly onto the blank tickets.
Play continues until all the rivers for a level have been identified, or all clues have been used.  (Note: One, two, or all three levels of play may constitute a game.)  The team with the greatest number of points is the winner.

"Title: Sandra Day O'Connor
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Writing, Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students learn about the first female judge of the United States Supreme Court in honor of Women's History Month.  They answer questions about the judicial branch of the United States government.
Directions: First Female Associate Justice
What does it take to be appointed to the highest court in the land?  How long did Sandra prepare for her job?  How did she have time to be a mother, a deputy attorney, assistant attorney general, a state senator, and a judge for 24 years?
From the time Sandra was a child living on a ranch in Arizona, she excelled at everything.  She learned how to read by the time she was four, drove a truck at the age of eight, and could ride a horse with the best of them.  Her parents knew that raising a little girl all by herself out in the middle of a huge ranch was going to be a tough job.  When it was time for Sandra to go to school, her parents decided to send her to El Paso, the big city, to live with her grandparents, Mamie and Willis Wiley.  Sandra would never live on the ranch full-time again.  From a private school in El Paso to graduating third in her class at Stanford, Sandra was always an achiever.  She worked very hard to be the best student she could be.
Sandra loved ranching and geology and does not remember why she chose law as a career.  She did admit that studying the law kept her busy because there were so many ways of interpreting the law.  While she was in college, she met her future husband, John O'Connor.  After graduation, her husband was offered five positions in law firms, but Sandra could not find a job as an attorney. 
No one wanted a woman.  She was offered a position as a legal secretary.  This roadblock did not stop her.  She soon secured the job of Assistant Deputy County Attorney of San Mateo, California. 
Sandra was always persistent.  She was a quiet, organized, and efficient woman who never let anything fluster her.  She was in control, no matter what happened to her or around her.  Sandra said that she would prefer practicing law to being a head of state. 
Sandra Day O'Connor became the first woman associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.  In 1981, during Ronald Reagan's presidency, she succeeded the retiring Justice Potter Stewart.
Suggested Activities

Knowledge: What kind of education was Sandra given?
Comprehension: Was Sandra always successful?
Creative Thinking: Why do you think that Sandra wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice?
Application: Have you ever thought about being an attorney or running for an office?  For which office would you run?
Analysis: Can all women have such spectacular careers and also be good mothers?
Synthesis: Can anyone become a Supreme Court Justice?
Evaluation: Is your life similar to Sandra's?  In what ways?  In what ways does it differ?
Affective: Would you have the energy and resolve to become a Supreme Court Justice?


Skills Focus


Language and Communication Skills: Write a letter to your representative in congress and ask him/her to give you the reasons for becoming a public official.
Independent Study Skills: What kinds of courts can be found on the state and national levels?  Describe all of these in their own paragraphs.

"Title: African American Concentration
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students increase their awareness of the important contributions made by individuals throughout history.
Directions: Discuss with students the origins of African American history month.  In 1926, a scholar named Carter Woodson felt that African Americans did not know about the achievements of their collective past.  He instituted Negro History Week as a time to learn about and celebrate these past achievements.  In 1976, this celebration became a month-long one, and is seen as a time to reflect on achievements and contributions that may still be too little known. 
In this activity, students play Concentration by matching the picture and name of a famous African American with his or her biographical sketch.
Provide students with copies of the African American activity pages.  Read over the biographical information with students.  If you would like students to make cards of their own, provide copies of blank cards.
Have students glue the cards onto one color of construction paper or tagboard and cut them out.  Now each student should have a set of 24 playing cards, 12 portraits (pictures) with names, and 12 biographical sketches.

"Title: Simulation: An Irresistable Offer?
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Oral Language, Listening, Speaking, Social Studies, United States History, World History
Objective: Students will identify inducements the emperor Constantine offered people to move to his fledgling capital city of Constantinople and compare similar situations offered by the American government in our history and by local governments for business purposes today.
Directions: Preparation

Make one copy of the contract for each team in the class.
Obtain the reward.

Procedure

Have students divide into cooperative learning teams of about four students each.  Lay out the bag of candy or gum in plain view of the entire class.  (You may even partake of it in order to better set the tone of your announcement.)  Explain to the class, ""I'm going to make a deal with each team today.  The team that follows through on their deal with me will walk away with this goodie bag.""
The ""deal"" is this.  Each team is to discuss what it thinks each member could possibly score on the next chapter or unit test.  Prompt students by pointing out that individual goals should be relatively high but realistically attainable.  The team should then use the Team Goal Contract to list each individual member's name, his or her goal, and the team's subsequent average goal.
The teacher is to collect the Team Goal Contract from each team and announce what each team has offered in return for the reward.  It is important to stress that what is offered is not a deal until the goal has actually been met.  The team that meets the highest goal will be rewarded.
After all student questions concerning the deal have been discussed, the teacher will use the offer as an introduction to the Byzantium Empire.  Discuss Constantine's founding of Constantinople and see if students are able to compare his offers (See Background.) to events in our nation's past or present.
Encourage student teams to form study groups outside of class as much as possible and to use class time to its fullest in order to reach their desired goal.  Remind them that it makes no difference if another team has a higher goal if that group of students doesn't reach it.  Emphasize that team members should encourage each other.  Each individual can control how much effort he or she puts into preparing for the chapter or unit test.

Background
In 330 a.d., the Roman emperor Constantine moved his capital out of Rome and into the old Asia Minor city of Byzantium along the Bosporous Strait, which connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara and, ultimately, the Aegean Sea.  He quadrupled the size of old Byzantium and renamed it Constantinople in his honor.  Constantine, who was the first emperor of Rome to embrace Christianity, did build a few churches in his new city.  However, numerous other reasons could be given to explain his abandonment of Rome.  His new location was along established and well-protected trade routes; the eastern half of the Roman Empire was materially better off than the west; Germanic invaders were more prevalent in the west; political intrigue was rampant in Rome.
To help build his city and give it credibility, Constantine offered inducements for many to follow him to Constantinople.  He offered to build palaces for wealthy patricians if they relocated to Constantinople.  He also offered large tracts of land and annual payments of grain for numerous years to come.
Although Constantine's offer met with very limited success, Constantinople grew into an extremely prosperous city, which remained the secure headquarters of the eastern Roman Empire (later named the Byzantine Empire) until its fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.  Noted for a variety of trading enterprises and other businesses, its populace was well educated.  Meanwhile, Rome, having been sacked several times by barbarians in the fifth century a.d., retreated into the backwater of history.
Much of the United States was settled in a somewhat similar fashion through the Homestead Act of 1862, which opened up vast areas of the Great Plains.  One notable difference is that those that homesteaded the American frontier were usually of a lower economic class who would not normally have been able to afford the land.
In the present day, however, a different sort of deal is often reported in newspapers nationwide.  Tax abatements are offered by municipal and county governments to lure various industries and their employment opportunities into their communities.  Derided by some as ""corporate welfare"" and praised by others who view the jobs created or saved by such practices as absolutely necessary, tax abatement is somewhat analogous to Constantine's offer of almost two thousand years ago.  Constantine counted upon relocating wealthy Romans to add to the stature and economic stability of his new capital.
Extensions

Have students research the Homestead Act.  They may write a report or create a display board.  This may be very appropriate if students live in that part of the country where the Homestead Act was the means for settling the frontier.
Students may also focus on current events.  Interested students could bring in newspaper articles about local tax abatement issues.  Perhaps informed speakers could offer pro and con arguments on the issue.  Students themselves might be able to research the topic (if it is newsworthy enough in their area) and have a classroom debate on it.

"Title: Simulation: Ancient Democracy
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Oral Language, Listening, Speaking, Social Studies, Ancient History
Objective: Students will describe which segments of society were included in the original Athenian democracy.  They will compare and contrast early Greek democracy to democracy as it is exercised in the United States today.
Directions: Preparation

Make enough copies of the role cards so there is the following ratio: Ecclesia cards should number one-half the male membership of the class.  Metic and servant cards combined should equal one-half the male membership of the class.
Cut out the required number of role cards.  (Cards may be laminated for future use.)

Procedure

Initiate a discussion with the class regarding an upcoming project.  Tell them that you are undecided about what kind of project you want them to do (about any topic you may be currently studying).  Explain that you have thought about a report, a diorama, a play, a mural, etc.  However, you have decided to let democracy rule on this project.
Pass out the needed number of role cards at random to male students only.
Explain that only those students who possess an Ecclesia card may enter into discussion about the proposed project.
    As deftly as possible, garner responses only from those boys holding an Ecclesia card.  Those boys holding other cards or the girls of the class must be politely, but firmly, told that their opinion in this matter doesn't count.
    Hold a vote on the project choices, allowing only ecclesia members to vote.

For Discussion
After eligible voters have made their decision, the instructor may have to deal with some upset students.  The following questions may help defuse and clarify the lesson succinctly:

How was or wasn't this a democratic way of dealing with the project dilemma?  (Some students got to vote, but only a minority were able to do so.)
What part of the classroom membership was totally left out of the decision-making process? (the girls)
Who among the boys were not able to participate in the ""democratic"" process? (those with cards marked ""Servant"" and ""Metic"")


Inform students that this activity simulates the earliest forms of democracy as it was born in Ancient Greece.  Metics, or foreign males, and servants or slaves, as well as women, were denied a part in the governing process.  Only those males age 18 and over whose ancestors had been citizens of Athens were given the right to vote.  Have students compare those qualifications to modern voter qualifications in our country.  
(All citizens--those born in the United States and those legally naturalized--age 18 and older may vote, regardless of race, religion, gender, or political beliefs.)
Background
The idea of democracy was a radical concept for Ancient Greece of 500 B.C.  For over 500 years the Greek city-states had been ruled by oligarchies--small groups of aristocratic men who made all major decisions for the city-state.  The Athenian democratic ideal developed methodically, commencing with the great law-giver, Solon, in 594 B.C. and continuing with a civil official named Cleisthenes.  By the time Pericles became a significant government official in Athens (461 B.C.), all common male citizens whose ancestors had been Athenian citizens were able to direct the course of government.
At the height of its power, Athens had a population of approximately 200,000 people of whom about 50,000 constituted the male citizenry.  This citizenry met by tribe on a monthly basis to decide issues handed to them by a more exclusive governing assembly.  Large numbers of foreigners and slaves, as well as the women, had no voice whatsoever.  In effect, Western man's initial experiment with democracy was extremely limited, since a minority led the majority.
Follow-Up
Check with your local board of elections to see what percent of eligible adults are registered to vote in that area.  Also, ask what percent of eligible voters actually cast ballots in the last election.  In all likelihood, a self-chosen minority of citizens are making decisions for the majority even to this day.
This could lead to further discussion or an essay for the students, ""The Value of a Vote.""
The aforementioned Cleisthenes also introduced the concept of ostracism to the ecclesia.  The citizenry of Athens could deem a particular person as dangerous to the state and, by a majority vote, have that person exiled for 10 years.  If an instructor is open to some controversy and has some advanced students, he or she may pose the question as to what public figure in the United States should be ostracized if it were legal.  The debate could be interesting even if the idea is unconstitutional.

"Title: Simulation: Ancient Greece (Sparta)
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Fluency, Reading Comprehension, Oral Language, Listening, Speaking, Social Studies, Ancient History
Objective: Students will identify that Spartan civilization was founded upon a militaristic point of view that allowed no tolerance for contrary views or physical limitations.
Directions: Preparation
Make a copy of the dilemma for each student.
Procedure

Have students grouped in teams of four.  Have one student chosen as a team recorder.
Pass out the copies of the dilemma.  Orally read ""Commander Lear"" to the class.
Have students within each group take turns listing positive qualities of the main character, Commander Lear.  The recorder should list these qualities.  In a similar manner, have team members take turns listing negative characteristics of Commander Lear.
For the remaining questions, have students pair off within each team and discuss them.  After pairs have discussed the questions, they should share their responses with the other pair within the team.
The whole class should reconvene, and the teacher should review the items of the dilemma by allowing each team to share either their positive/negative qualities lists or their views on one of the other questions.
Explain to the class that they will begin learning about a ""civilized"" Ancient Greek city-state that promoted most of the actions presented in ""Commander Lear.""

Background
Sparta, Athen's perennial nemesis among the Greek city-states, was founded on the idea of military might producing economic right.  Like most city-states on the Greek peninsula, Sparta was unable to support itself solely from the products of the rocky, infertile soil.  However, while most Greeks turned to the sea for trade and commerce, Sparta made the conscious decision to aggressively impose its will on neighboring city-states, subjugating their people into forced labor for the benefit of Sparta.
As a result, Spartan society developed into three classes.  Spartans were the military faction of society constituting a mere five percent of the people.  The vast majority of the people were traders, artisans, and slaves.  The former enjoyed some freedoms while the latter had virtually none.
A Spartan male left home at age seven to enter into severe military training lasting until he became 20, whereupon he was considered in active service until the age of 60.  While marriage was permitted, no Spartan could live with his wife until the age of 30.
Women were trained to be good wives of soldiers, and the ""soft"" education of the arts, literature, and philosophy were frowned upon as being unworthy for a warrior.  Newborns were examined shortly after birth.  Any birth defect or hint of infirmity immediately sentenced the infant to death by exposure, and it was left on a mountainside to die.  Imperfect specimens would not be accepted in Spartan society.
""A Spartan Dilemma"" is designed to be an anticipatory set prior to the class study of this Greek civilization.  If time permits after the study has been completed, the instructor may wish to allow students to make a comparison between the Spartan attitude towards society and Hitler's view of an Aryan ""master race"" in Nazi Germany.  For a more contemporary comparison, these Spartan ideas may be compared to the various supremacist groups that often make the news with their elitist racial diatribes.

"Title: Ancient River Civilizations
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, Ancient History
Objective: Students will discuss with their classmates the various reasons for the growth of the Ancient River Civilizations.
Directions: Egypt is an example of one of the great River Civilizations that appeared in the Middle Eastern region around 3000 B.C.  Others were Persia, Arabia, Syria, Sumer, and Babylon.  Since we have no written records from this time, we are left to speculate as to the reasons why these civilizations appeared at this particular time and in this particular place.  Since proximity to rivers played a large role in the development of these communities, it is important to ask some questions about the influence of the rivers on the development of these ancient civilizations.  Because we do not have written information, we are forced to make theories or hypotheses about how these civilizations were started.
Based upon their knowledge of the ancient cultures, direct students to discuss in small groups which of the following hypotheses would most likely explain the growth of River Civilizations.  They can make their speculations on the activity sheet:  The Growth of River Civilizations.
Hypotheses: 
1.The annual flooding deposited a layer of silt, enriching the soil and making it suitable for farming.  This rich soil was able to support large numbers of people in a small area.  Even in dry years the river valley was attractive to people because of the availability of water for irrigation.
2.The growing of wheat and barley was possible because of the reliable water supply.  These grains could be stored for use by towns or villages on the riverbank.  This left leisure-time for other activities, such as building houses.
3.The surplus food supply meant that people could specialize in jobs, such as building, copper smithing, or trading.   In this way, stable villages and towns grew up around these markets and craft centers.  It was no longer necessary for everyone to be involved in hunting or farming.
4.Annual flooding and irrigation required large-scale cooperation and direction.  From this need, larger communities developed.  These groups created leaders and a form of government.  The pharaohs of Egypt probably began as such leaders. 
5.Settlements along rivers were more likely to be open to new ideas and techniques from other communities farther along the river.  The river was a highway for the spread of new ideas.
6.A chance invention or discovery (e.g. irrigation wheel, grinding stone) could have dramatically increased food production, thus making larger settlements possible.
Extended Activities:
Have students compare and create ancient and modern maps of the area of the river civilizations, listing both the old and the new names to connect our study to what is happening in today's news.  Ask students to discuss some of the things that seem to have changed little over the centuries.

"Title: Buying and Selling Stocks
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Data Analysis and Probability, Social Studies
Objective: Students learn about the stock market.
Directions: Ask students what they know about the stock market, leading them into a discussion of what the stock market is.
The term stock market refers to the buying and selling of shares, or stock, in all kinds of companies, both in the United States and around the world.  The stock market allows everyone who wishes to participate a chance to own a part of any publicly held company--that is, any company that sells stock to investors.  In this way, the stock market raises capital, or money, that a company can use in order to continue to produce its product or offer its services.  In return for the use of investors' money, if the company does well, investors reap a profit; if the company does poorly, investors see a loss.
How does the stock market work?  Imagine that there is a company called Hawaiian Plantation that makes all kinds of tropical snack foods you like to eat.  You think it would be fun to have a part of that company--and you can.  You can buy shares of Hawaiian Plantation stock.  As long as the macadamia and pineapple crops are doing well and Hawaiian Plantation is able to generate a profit, the shares that you buy will increase in value.  But if a hurricane hits and most of the pineapple crop is wiped out for a year, Hawaiian Plantation may have to raise its retail prices too high to attract buyers to its product on the supermarket shelf.  Hawaiian Plantation loses money, and you do, too, as investors sell off their stock, and the price of remaining stock plummets.
Where do you go to buy stock?  Stock is not a product like chocolate-covered macadamia nuts.  Traditionally, stock is purchased from a broker who charges a commission, or fee, for his or her services.  (It is possible to buy stocks online through the Internet without a broker, but a broker also gives recommendations and advice about stocks that a person may want.)  The broker's job is to send a message to the floor broker, who literally walks the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange) when there is a buyer for Hawaiian Plantation stock.  The floor broker actually buys stock from a company that specializes in this type of stock.  
The floor broker then reports to the broker that the stock was purchased.  The broker reports the trade through computers.  In this way, the rise and fall of stock prices gets reported throughout the business day.  Generally, you would not get the actual stock certificate for your Hawaiian Plantation stock, but the broker keeps your purchase in his or her records.  If you ever want to sell your Hawaiian Plantation stock, you let the broker know, and the process happens in reverse, with the broker charging another commission.  
Remember that thousands and thousands of transactions like this take place, and as a result, millions and millions of dollars change hands on the stock market daily.  The value of stock in various companies can determine the health of the nation's economy.  Far more than Fort Knox, the stock market is at the center of American economic activity.
Ask students the following questions:
1.Why would a company decide not to sell stock?
2.What happens when a stock splits?
3.Would you rather invest in a company that makes a product, such as a food manufacturer, or one that sells a service, such as a hotel chain?  Why?
4.If a company has an unprofitable year, should you as a stockholder automatically sell your stock?  Why or why not?  Can you think of reasons to hold onto a stock over time?
Distribute the activity sheets and have students practice buying and selling stocks.

"Title: Simulation: Connecting Osiris
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Oral Language, Listening, Speaking, Social Studies, Ancient History
Objective: Students will identify Ancient Egypt as the origin of the idea that moral worth was the key to eternal life.
Directions: Background 
The idea that moral constitution, not material wealth, dictated eternal happiness started in Egypt about four thousand years ago.  Its origin is in the legend of Osiris, one of the sons of Ra, who was killed and dismembered by his evil brother, Seth.  Osiris's wife, Isis, gathered the various parts of Osiris' body, and he came back to life to serve as the god of the dead.  He would determine the worthiness of any dead person by placing the person's heart on a balance offset with the weight of a feather.  If the heart was light and good, it would balance, and the person would be welcomed into eternity.  A heart maligant with wickedness would easily tip the scales, and that person would be thrown to a voracious monster to be devoured.
Preparation
Make an overhead transparency of the Osiris picture.
Make copies of the Osiris picture equal to the number of student teams within the class.
Cut each copy of Osiris into approximately 20-24 irregularly shaped pieces.  (Each may be cut separately, or several copies may be cut together to expedite the process.)
Place pieces for each copy into separate plastic bags.
Procedure
Ask the students if they understand the concept of immortality or eternal life.  Allow some discussion of their ideas of eternity.
Pass out the Osiris puzzle bags to each team.
Instruct students that they will unlock the key to the Ancient Egyptians' view of immortality as they work the puzzle in front of them.  Project the image of Osiris on the overhead.
Allow student teams time to complete their respective puzzles.
After groups have successfully completed their puzzles, share the importance of Osiris' legend with the students (See background information above.)  Have students compare the Egyptian version of eternity with that of the Ancient Mesopotamians.  Which one would be more favorable?  (The Egyptians had a much more positive view of eternity than the Mesopotamians.)
Follow-Up
Have students compile a list of values or virtues that they think are important.  These lists may be developed and discussed in teams and/or whole class sessions.
The teacher may want to ask students to write a descriptive paper on what they perceive eternal life to be.  They may cite religious beliefs or other references for their particular conceptions.

"Title: Consumerism Scavenger Hunt
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies
Objective: Students will work with a partner to use the Internet to conduct research about a series of questions that relate to consumers and their spending habits.  Students will participate in a class discussion about the data they gathered regarding consumers and their spending habits.  This will involve analyzing conflicting answers to questions.
Directions: When students enter the classroom, advertisements will be displayed everywhere.  Have a videotape of advertisements playing.  An audiotape of sample ads can also be running.  As students assemble to begin class, mute audio and discontinue video.  Open class by asking students what all of the items on display have in common.  Facilitate a short discussion about the items and how they are related.  Next, tell students they are about to embark on a journey where they will learn about advertising techniques, they will become more informed consumers, and they will use what they have learned to create and market a product that might make them rich and famous one day.  Explain that in order to do this, they will need to be able to research and find information.  Hand out the Consumerism Scavenger Hunt and the Internet Research Guidelines.  Go over the directions on both with the group.  Next, give students 1-2 minutes to find, or you can assign, scavenger hunt partners.  Tell students that the group who has the most correct answers will receive some sort of prize.  Give students the remainder of the class period to find as much information as possible using the Internet (preferably a lab setting).  Shortly before the end of the class period, stop research and have students gather materials.  Remind them that they can use other references to research in their free time and that they will have an additional class period to collect research on the next day.
On the next day, do a quick check-in with students to see that everyone has necessary handouts from the previous day.  Remind students that they want to answer as many questions as they can accurately.  Give them the remainder of the class period to work with their partners to conduct Internet research.  Shortly before the end of the class period, collect each group's Scavenger Hunt answers.
On the third day, begin class by returning Scavenger Hunt papers to students.  Use the class period to discuss the correct answers to the Scavenger Hunt questions.  Encourage students to volunteer the information they found when answering each question.  Be sure to discuss conflicting answers to various questions, as all students will not find identical information.  At the end of the discussion, present prizes to winning group(s).  If time permits, this would be a good day to have students complete index cards so the teacher can begin planning design teams that will be used on Day 12.

"Title: The Aurora
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will learn about the aurora lights.
Directions: Background
The aurora borealis (northern lights) and aurora australis (southern lights) have been sources of myth since ancient times.  These beautiful phenomena appear as thin veils of colored light, usually green, moving silently across the sky.  Today, we know they result from disturbances in the magnetic field surrounding Earth (geomagnetic field).  The disturbances are caused by interaction with the solar wind, a continuous flow of electrically charged particles from the sun.  When there are many sunspots on the sun, increased particles are released and, thus, there is a brighter aurora.  The aurora is usually visible only from latitudes near the geomagnetic poles but may be seen nearer the equator during times of peak sunspot activity.  The aurora occurs in the upper atmosphere, usually 60-620 miles (97-1,000 km) above Earth.
Classroom Activity
Use the transparency Earth's Magnetic Tail to review information learned in the previous lesson.
Show the students pictures of aurora of Jupiter and Saturn.
Visit the Web site below as an introduction to the students.  Explain that when people first saw these beautiful displays in the sky, they were afraid.  Not knowing what caused them, they made up stories to explain these phenomena.  Tour the spectacular photos and read the information on pages 1-4.  If possible, use a large monitor to show the details.
The Aurora -- http://gedds.pfrr.alaska.edu/aurora/english/intro1.htm
Tell students that they will visit a variety of Web sites to learn more.  One site comes from the University of Alaska, near the North Geomagnetic Pole.  Show where Fairbanks is located relative to the North Geomagnetic Pole.
Divide students into groups and give each a research card.  Assign more students to the starred cards since they require a longer time to complete.  Review the assignments and set a time to complete the research and prepare a presentation for the class.
Before presenting their information in the order of the cards, have each group meet with those presenting before and after them to coordinate and avoid repeating information provided by another group.
Assessment
Have students write their own illustrated legend to explain the aurora and then add a summary of the scientific explanation they have learned.
Extender

"Title: Tracking a Hurricane
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will track a hurricane to simulate what meteorologists do.
Directions: Cut out the transparency of the hurricane shape.  Mark a copy of the Hurricane Map with the locations of the complete data to create an answer sheet.
Activity
Tell the students that it is September 3 at 6:00 a.m. and information about a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas has just been received.  The hurricane has been named Sam.  Place the map transparency on the overhead.  Find the coordinates for Hurricane Sam (20° N 64° W) and then, stick a dot on this location.  Show the students how to find the coordinates as you do so.  Put the transparency of the hurricane shape over the dot so that its center is over the dot.  Let the students know that at this point, it has been decided that a hurricane warning and evacuation order will be sent to both the Bahamas and Dominican Republic. Show where these are located on the map.
Explain to the students that they are going to be meteorologists working at a hurricane center and following the progress of Hurricane Sam.  Divide the students into six groups and provide each group a copy of the map, data pages, and six adhesive dots.   Have them read the data and see that it is updated every 12 hours.  Tell them to use the technique you showed them and plot the progress of the hurricane on their maps.  Tell them to mark each new data on the map in pencil first and then, place the dot over it.  Monitor the groups at first to be sure they understand what to do and are sharing the responsibilities.
Because students mark the new location each time, they should decide what action they will take such as, order evacuations or give only warnings.  Discuss with them the consequences of giving evacuation orders as opposed to warnings.
Closure
As the students work, plot the seven hurricane locations on the transparency, using the answer map prepared earlier.  Discuss their answers for the warnings they gave as the hurricane progressed.  These will vary with the groups.  Lead the students in a final analysis of the hurricane warnings they gave.  Help them understand how difficult this is in real life situations.

"Title: View of a Comet from Earth
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will learn about viewing a comet from Earth.
Directions: Follow the instructions to assemble the transparencies of the orbits of Earth and a comet.  Place this on an overhead projector and have students look at the comet in the various locations of its orbit around the sun.  Discuss what they see happening to the comet from positions 1-9.  (The tail forms and lengthens as it nears the sun, and then diminishes as it moves away from the sun.  The tail always points away from the sun.)
Rotate Earth's orbit disk until the planet is at the #1 position.  Draw a line with a wet-erase pen from Earth to the comet in the #1 position and another from Earth to the sun.  Have students tell what the comet would look like from Earth at this time.  (There is no tail; since the comet is far from the Earth, it would appear very dim and small.) Ask them where it would appear in the sky relative to the sun.  (It would be about 45 degrees from the sun.) Erase the lines.
Move Earth to #2 and draw the lines again.  Distribute drawing paper to students and have them draw what the comet would look like from Earth, showing the comet and the sun.  (The comet would have a short tail, difficult to see since Earth's view would be nearly straight at the coma.  The comet would be somewhat closer to the sun.)
Move Earth to #3 and have the students add the new picture of the comet to their drawing.  (The comet's tail will be longer, and it will be closer to the sun.)
Continue moving Earth to each position and have students make drawings to show what they would see.  (The comet would disappear in the glare of the sun at #5.)
Add the dates to the comet positions on the transparency and have the students place them on their drawings as well, beginning at #2.  (1) May 15, (2) July 1, (3) August 1, (4) August 25, (5) September 1, (6) September 8, (7) October 2, (8) November 1, (9) December 18
Ask students to look at the comet's motion and explain it.  (The comet moves slowly from #1 to #3, speeds up between #4 and #6, and then slows down again.  As the comet is pulled toward the sun, it slowly adds speed and then moves fastest when close to the sun, slowing down again, once it begins to travel away from the sun.)
Place an X on one of the places where the comet crosses through Earth's orbit.  Explain that a comet's orbit is usually not in the same plane as Earth's orbit but may come in at an angle so that it actually crosses the orbit at only one point.  Ask students what happens to the comet as its core heats up when it gets close to the sun.  (It loses dirt from its core.)
Explain that this dirt becomes trapped in Earth's orbit here.  Rotate Earth to that spot and ask what happens when Earth returns to this part of its orbit again.  (Earth's gravity pulls some pieces into its atmosphere.  We see these as meteors.)
The Visual Dictionary of the Universe and The Young Astronomer have lists of some of the famous comets and their periods (length of time for one trip around the sun).  Show the students that some of these will be visible in their lifetime; however, remind them that there will also be new comets appearing as well.

"Title: Volcanic Unrest
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science
Objective: Students learn how scientists determine how dangerous an active volcano might be.
Directions: Tell students that many mountains in countries like Japan are actually active volcanoes.  Scientists in Japan study many aspects of their volcanoes, including lava viscosity.  Viscosity is the internal friction of a liqud, or its ability to run fast or slow.  Water is a liquid with low viscosity, and so it runs freely.  Liquids such as honey and maple syrup both have high viscosity, making them thick and slow moving.  By studying the viscosity of lava, scientists can determine how dangerous an active volcano might be.  It is the amount of silica in the lava that determines its viscosity.  A volcano with small amounts of silica has a low viscosity.  It is swift moving and able to destroy surrounding areas quickly without much time for evacuation.  The more silica in the lava, the thicker and slower it flows.<br />
By studying the lava viscosity, scientists can also determine the type of volcano that will be formed.  For example, the lava from Mount St. Helens is highly viscous, and so the slow-moving lava created a steep-sided volcano.  On the other hand, the lava found in the Hawaiian Islands is thin and swift moving, creating flat volcanoes.<br />
Have students try the following experiment:<br />
Gather four clear household liquids with a variety of viscosity.<br />
Pour the same amount of each liquid into four tall, clear beakers or graduated cylinders.  Label the beakers A, B, C, and D.  Imagine the four cylinders are lava taken from four different volcanoes in Japan.  It is your job as the scientist to test the lava viscosity and report to the public the dangers posed by each volcano.<br />
Use a stopwatch and four marbles to test the viscosity of the lave and record your findings on the activity sheet.  Begin with sample A.  Describe the liquid and then time how long it takes for a marble to drop through the liquid to the bottom of the container.  Record your findings on the chart.  Based on the speed of the marble, predict the amount of silica in this lava sample and record your prediction on the chart by placing an X along the scale and drawing a picture of the volcano that would be formed.<br />
Continue this procedure with the three other lava samples.  Then make a report to the people living in the areas around each of the volcanoes.  What kind of warning would each receive?

"Title: Calculating Interest
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.), Problem Solving, Fractions
Objective: Students learn how fractions, decimals, and percents relate to other numbers and concepts.
Directions: Facts to Know
When money is borrowed, you must pay to use it because someone else is losing an opportunity to use it while you have it.  What you pay to use the money is called interest.  The rate of interest is a percent.  The money you borrow is called the principal.  Simple interest is paid only on the principal.
The Interest Formula
To calculate the amount of simple interest on a loan, use this formula:
Interest = Principal x Rate of Interest x Time (or) I = PRT
Rate of Interest 
The rate of interest is always given as a percent.  You often see rates of interest on loans and investments posted outside of banks.
Time
Time in connection with loans is always expressed in years or parts of a year.
1 month =  1/12 of a year
6 months =  6/12  or  1/2 year
Calculating Interest
To find simple interest, use the formula I = PRT
Sample:  How much would a loan of $500 be at 6% interest for 6 months?
Step 1  Use the interest formula.  The formula to calculate interest is this:
Interest = Principal x Rate of Interest x Time (I = P x R x T)
Step 2  Change the rate, given as a percent, to a fraction and reduce.  Set up time as a fraction of a year.
R =   6/100  =   3/50
T =  6/12  = 1/2
Step 3  Multiply principal x rate x time.  Cancel where possible.
I = 500/1   x   3/50  x  1/2  =  $15
or, after cancelling, I = 5/I x 3/1 x 1/1=$15
You can also change the percent to a decimal (6% = .06) and the time to a decimal 
(6 months =  6/12 = .5) and then multiply.
I = $500.00 x .06 x .5 = $15
Sample:  A T-shirt costs $24.99 and a pair of jeans costs $34.99.  Each is on sale for 25% off the original price.  If Jenna bought the T-shirt and jeans while they were on sale, what was her total price before adding tax?  What is the total amount that Jenna had to pay for her purchase after tax was added?  (Tax is 8%.)
$24.99 original T-shirt pricex 0.25 discount------$6.2475 = $6.25 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)$24.99-$6.25------$18.74 sale price for T-shirt$34.99 original jeans pricex 0.25 discount------$8.7475 = $8.75 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)$34.99-$8.75------$26.24 sale price for jeans

Jenna paid $18.74 + $26.24 = $44.98 for the T-shirt and jeans.
Discounts and Sales
A discount is used by manufacturers and merchants to mean taking off a certain percentage of the price given in a price list.  This price is called the list price.  The list price less the discount is known as the net price.  The noun ""discount"" can be used as a verb, too--""We're discounting by 15% the list price on all new cars and trucks during our storewide 'Get into Spring' sale!""
You would ask ""What's the discount?"" but not, ""What's the sale?""  Often you have to figure out your own savings during a sale, and this is where understanding decimals and percents comes in handy.
Let's say, for instance, you read that a local amusement park is offering a single, one-day pass to all rides for $12.50, or a special two-day pass for $20.00.  You do some quick decimal arithmetic.
$12.50 one-day passx    2------$25.00 So your savings on a two day pass is the following: $25.00 one-day pass-$20.00 two-day pass-------- $5.00But, just curious--what percent off is that?$ 5.00    n                          $ 5.00   100   500------ = --- --> invert and multiply ------ x --- = ---  or 20% off$25.00   100                         $25.00    n    25

Description: Mathematics, Data Analysis and Probability
Objective: Students will learn how to determine the probability that an event will occur.
Directions: Go over the following facts and reminders with the students.  Use coins and dice to illustrate the different probabilities.

Facts and Reminders
Whether an event is likely to happen can be expressed by a number.  This number expresses the probability or likelihood that a particular event will occur.  You can determine the probability that an event will occur by counting all of the possible outcomes.
Flipping One Coin
When you flip a coin, only two possible outcomes can result.  You have one chance in two of flipping heads (or tails).  If you flip the coin 50 times, you have 1/2 x 50 or 25 likely flips with heads showing.  When you actually flip the coin, however, the results may be quite different.  The more times you flip the coin, however, the greater the likelihood that you will end up with exactly half the coin flips as heads.
Flipping Two Coins
Listed below are the possible outcomes when you flip two coins.  (H = heads, T = tails, 1 = first coin, and 2 = second coin)
H1 H2

"Title: Commutative Property and Associative Property
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.)
Objective: Students learn about properties of multiplication.
Directions: Introduce students to Commutative and Associative properties with the following information.
The Commutative Property of Multiplication states that when the order of the factors is changed, the product stays the same.  Multiplication is a commutative operation.  For example, in the equation 5 x 9, the order of the factors does not affect the answer because 5 x 9 = 45 and 9 x 5 = 45.  The Commutative Property works for any number of factors.  Show students the following examples:
Example A
30 x 80 = 80 x 30
30 x 80 = 2, 400
80 x 30 = 2, 400
Example B
10 x 9 x 8 = 8 x 9 x 10
10 x 9 x 8 = 720
8 x 9 x 10 = 720
The Associative Property of Multiplication states that when the grouping of the factors is changed, the product stays the same.  The way the factors are grouped within parentheses does not affect the answer.  Multiplication is associative.  Show students the following examples:
Example C
5 x (8 x 9) = (5 x 8) x 9
5 x (8 x 9) = 360
(5 x 8) x 9 = 360
Example D
30 x (50 x 90) = (30 x 50) x 90
30 x (50 x 90) = 135, 000
(30 x 50) x 90 = 135, 000
Distribute copies of the activity sheets to students and have them apply these properties to solve the problems on the pages.

"Title: Fancy Factorials
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Algebra and Function, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.)
Objective: Students learn about and work with factorials.
Directions: Facts and Reminders
Ordering Two Objects
Have students place one red crayon and one blue crayon on their desks.  How many different ways can they arrange them?
There are two different ways.  They can put the red crayon first and the blue second, or they can put the blue first and the red second.
Ordering Three Objects
Have students place a third crayon, green, on their desks.  How many different ways can they arrange them?
There are six different ways.  Have them use their crayons to see if any arrangement has been missed.  Notice that red is first in two arrangements, second in two arrangements, and third in two arrangements.  This is true for each of the other colors as well.
Factorials
These arrangements can be expressed by a math concept called a factorial.  The two-color arrangement is expressed this way:  2! = 2 x 1 = 2
The three-color factorial is expressed this way:  3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6
The exclamation point (!) is the sign for a factorial.  Factorials can be multiplied:
2! x 3! = 2 x 1 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 12
Factorials can be divided:
3! / 2!  =  (3 x 2 x 1) / (2 x 1)= 3 / 2

"Title: Iditarod:  Statistics and Rates
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics
Objective: Students analyze statistical data and work with rates.
Directions: Introduce the Exploration
Ask the students if they have ever heard of the Iditarod.  Let them talk about it or tell them yourself that the Iditarod is a race of over 1,000 miles that mushers and their dogs run in Alaska.  Tell them that they will learn about this race in this exploration, and they will have an opportunity to work with data from the race.
Activity 1:  Prize Money
Have students use the website listed below to answer the following questions.  How much more does the first place winner make than the last place winner?  Express your answer in dollars, and then show the increase as a percentage.  You may need to review with your students how to calculate the percentage increase.
Activity 2:  The Red Lantern Musher
Have students find the most recent race that has data on the finishing time of the winner and the finishing time of the last place finisher, also known as the Red Lantern Musher.  They should calculate their rates of travel in miles per day to the nearest hundredth.  What is the difference in their rate of travel?  You may need to review with students how to calculate a rate.
Activity 3:  Winning Rates
Have students complete the following activities. You may need to review with your students how to calculate a rate.  The equation should be in the form t = d / r (where t = time, d = distance, and r = rate).
Find the times of the winner in 1973 and the most recent winner.  Calculate their rates of travel in miles per day to the nearest hundredth.  What is the difference in their rate of travel?
Imagine that the most recent winner can always run his or her dogs at the same rates no matter what the distance.  Write an equation that shows how to calculate the time to run a given distance. 
Imagine that the most recent winner ran his or her dogs for a distance of 1,300 miles at the rate you calculated in Part A.  Use the equation you wrote in Part B to calculate how much time it would take to go 1,300 miles.
Activity 4:  A Sample of Mushers
Have students complete the following activities. You may need to review the topic of probability with your students.  Help them understand that if their sample size was 10 and five out of the 10 mushers were between the ages of 40 and 49, then the probability of a musher being 40 to 49 in age is 5/10 or 1/2.  Discuss the results with your students.  If they came fairly close in the predictions they should feel successful in their ability to predict based on looking at a sample.
Look at the page that names the mushers.  You are going to try to predict the age of a musher.  First, you will look at the ages of many mushers.  How many mushers and their ages do you think you should look at in order to make an accurate prediction?  Once you decide how many mushers you need age information on (sample size), click on that number of mushers to collect the age data.  Use the chart on the work sheet to assign probabilities various age categories.
Make a prediction on the ages of a randomly selected group of 10 mushers.  Use the probabilities you created in Part A.

"Title: Improper Fractions
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Numbers and Numerations, Fractions
Objective: Students understand, represent, and apply numbers in the form of fractions.
Directions: Facts and Reminders:

Improper Fractions
An improper fraction always has a numerator equal to or greater than the denominator.  The examples below are all improper fractions.





            3/2 


            9/9  


            11/10  


            15/3   


            22/12  


            12/9





Improper fractions are always equal to or greater than one.  An improper fraction always means one or more than one whole object.  It is one pizza or more than one pizza.  It is one complete bag of candy or more than one complete bag.

Mixed Numbers
A mixed number contains a whole number and a fraction.  It is always greater than one.  For example, it might be one whole pizza and part of another.  A mixed number might indicate three whole pies and part of another pie.  Look at the examples below.

Here are more mixed numbers.





            1 1/3


            2 2/5


            7 1/2


            3 1/4


            4 2/7


            8 1/6





Changing Improper Fractions to Mixed Numbers or Whole Numbers
An improper fraction can be reduced to a whole number or a mixed number by dividing the denominator into the numerator.  The quotient can be written as a whole number and the remainder, if there is one, as a fraction.  Look at the example below.

Here are more examples.







            3/2  =  1 1/2


            7/5  =  1 2/5


            12/4    =  3





The mixed number 1 1/2 and the improper fraction 3/2 both indicate the same amount.  The mixed number 1 2/5 and the improper fraction 7/5 both equal the same amount.  The whole number 3 and the improper fraction 12/4   indicate the same amount.

Objective: Students learn about multiples, common multiples, least common multiples, and lowest common denominators.
Directions: Discuss with students the following facts and reminders as they begin this activity.
Multiples
A multiple is the product resulting when two or more factors are multiplied by each other.
5 x 4 = 20--The number 20 is a multiple of 4 and 5.
8 x 6 = 48--The number 48 is a multiple of 8 and 6.
The first five multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
The first five multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.
The first five multiples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40.
Common Multiples
A common multiple is a multiple common to two or more different factors.
The number 8 is a common multiple of both 2 and 4.
The number 6 is a common multiple of both 2 and 3.
The number 12 is a common multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 6.
The first six multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36.
The first eight multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32.
The numbers 12, 24, and 36 are common multiples of both 4 and 6.
The first six multiples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48.
The first four multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36, and 48.
The numbers 24 and 48 are common multiples of both 8 and 12.
Least Common Multiple
The least common multiple (LCM) is the smallest common multiple of two or more factors.
In the examples above, you will find the following: 
The least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12. 
The least common multiple of 8 and 12 is 24.
There are many larger common multiples of two factors.
Lowest Common Denominator
The least common multiple is used to determine the appropriate denominator for adding unlike fractions.  In adding unlike fractions, it is important to find the lowest common denominator of the fractions.  This is exactly the same thing as finding the least common multiple of the denominators.
    2       6   ---  =  ---    4      12     The lowest common denominator (LCD)+                 of 4 and 6 is 12.    1       2   ---  =  ---    6      12--------------            8       2           ---  =  ---           12       3

"Title: How to Multiply Decimals
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.), Fractions
Objective: Students learn how to multiply decimals.
Directions: Facts to Know
You multiply decimals the same way you multiply whole numbers.  Also, the decimal points do not have to be lined up.  However, you must be careful to correctly place the decimal point in the product for multiplication.  The number of decimal places in the answer must equal the total number of places to the right of the decimal point in the problem.
Decimal Points in the Final Answer
Multiplying decimals is the same as multiplying whole numbers.  The key is to count the decimal places in each factor.
Sample: 458 x 7.3 = ?
Step 1  Line up the digits.
Step 2  Multiply as with whole numbers.
Step 3  Count the decimal places in each factor.  The product must have an equal number of decimal places as the problem.



 45.8   


 x 7.3   


 ____   


 1374   


 + 32060   


 3,343.4   




Zero as a Place Holder
Remember, the product has the same number of decimal 
places as the factors.  Sometimes you have to add zeros as needed.



 21.45   


 x 0.0321   


 _______   


 2145   


 42900   


 +  643500   


 0.688545   




Multiplying Decimals by Whole Numbers
When multiplying decimals by whole numbers, counting off decimal places is the key.
Sample:  One inch contains 2.54 centimeters.  How many centimeters are there in four inches?
You must multiply the number of centimeters in one inch by four.
Step 1  Line up the numbers for easy multiplication.  You don't need to line up the decimal points, however.
Step 2  Multiply the numbers as you would multiply whole numbers.
Step 3  Count the number of decimal places in both numbers that you multiplied.  Make sure the decimal places in the product equal the number of decimal places in the problem.



 2.54   
 (2 decimal places)   


 x 4   
 (0 decimal places)   


 ____   
 


 10.16   
 (2 decimal places)   




So the final answer is 10.16 cm

"Title: Numerical Palindromes
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Numbers and Numerations, Problem Solving
Objective: Students develop an understanding of number relations.
Directions: Whether they are numbers or letters, palindromes have the unusal quality of being the same when read from left to right as when they are read from right to left.  The method given on the activity sheet is one way to generate a numerical palindrome.  You may wish to challenge students to find other ways this number trick can be accomplished.  The squares of certain integers also create palindromes.  For example, 1 x1 = 1, 11 x 11 = 121, 111 x 111 = 12321.  Does this pattern continue?  Challenge students to test this method with other numbers to determine if this will always produce palindromes.  If not, what are the limitations?  Can the students think of any other ways to produce palindromes?
Make sure that students know that they should show all their steps to solving problems.  They should make sure that their answers are clearly stated.

Palindrome Puzzle
Start with any number.
Example: 1279
Reverse the digits and add the reversed digits to the original number.
1279 + 9721 = 11000
Reverse the digits and add again.
11000 + 00011 = 11011
Continue the process until another palindrome is formed.
Multiplication Patterns
Don't use a calculator or pencil and paper to solve these problems.  Try to find the pattern from the answers shown.
40 x 40 = 1600
41 x 39 = 1599
42 x 38 = 1596
43 x 37 = 1591
44 x 36 = 1584
45 x 35 = 1575
Each answer can be computed by following these steps:

Multiply 40 x 40.
 Subtract the square of the counting number or digit after the 40.

Example
42

"Title: PEMDAS:  Order of Operations
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Algebra and Function, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.), Problem Solving
Objective: Students learn about the order of operations.
Directions: In algebra, there is a specific order in which operations are performed when evaluating an expression or solving equations.
This is the algebraic order of operations:

Do any work within parentheses ( ) or other grouping symbols [ ] first.
Do any work with exponents (powers) or roots.
Do any multiplication or division in order from left to right.
Do any addition and subtraction in order from left to right.

The acronym for this order of operations is PEMDAS.



Parentheses
Exponents
Multiplication
Division
Addition
Subtraction




A popular expression for remembering this is:  Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.
Sample A
Read the problem.
42 + (9 - 3) = ?
Do the work in the parentheses first.
42 + 6 = ?
Do the exponents next.
42 = 4 x 4 = 16, so16 + 6 = ?
Finally, add the numbers together.
16 + 6 = 22
Write your answer.
42 + (9 - 3) = 22
Sample B
Read the problem.
52 - (4 x 3) + 9 / 3 x 4 = ?
Do work in the parentheses first.
52 - 12 + 9 / 3 x 4 = ?
Do exponents next.
52 = 5 x 5 = 25, so25 - 12 + 9 / 3 x 4 = ?
Multiply and divide in order from left to right.
25 - 12 + 3 x 4 = ?
9 divided by 3 is 3, and 3 times 4 equals 12.
25 - 12 + 12 = ?
Add and subtract in order from left to right.
13 + 12 = ?
25 minus 12 is 13 and 13 plus 12 equals 25.
13 + 12 = 25
Write down your answer.
52 - (4 x 3) + 9 / 3 x 4 = 25
Using the Calculator
Many calculators are designed to follow the algebraic order of operations.  You can use the following problem to see if your calculator is programmed to follow the algebraic order of operations.
8 x 4 / 2 + 3 x 8 / 4 = ?
If your calculator answer was 22, it follows the order of operations.  (Unprogrammed calculators get an incorrect answer of 38.)

"Title: Perfect Numbers?
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Algebra and Function
Objective: Students learn about factors, perfect numbers, abundant numbers, and defective numbers,
Directions: Introduce to students the following information.
Perfect Numbers
Facts and Reminders
Proper Factors
The proper factors of a number are all of the factors of a number except the number itself.
Sample A
The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14.  The proper factors are 1, 2, and 7.  (Note:  The number itself, 14, is not included in the proper factors.)
Sample B
The factors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9.  (Note:  The 3 is not repeated.)  The proper factors are 1 and 3.
Numbers may be designated perfect, defective, or abundant based on the sum of their proper factors.

Perfect Numbers
A perfect number is equal to the sum of all of its factors, except the number itself.  Read the example below.
Sample
The proper factors of 6 are:  1, 2, and 3.  Add 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  Therefore, 6 is a perfect number.
There are no known odd perfect numbers.  Perfect numbers are very rare.

Abundant Numbers
Abundant numbers are those numbers where the sum of the proper factors is greater than the number itself.
Sample
The proper factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.  Add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6.  The sum, 16, is greater than 12 and 12 is, therefore, abundant.  The number 12 is the first abundant number.
There are only 21 abundant numbers between 12 and 100.

Defective (Deficient) Numbers
Defective numbers are those numbers in which the sum of the proper factors is less than the number itself.  Defective numbers are sometimes called deficient numbers.
Sample
The proper factors of 22 are 1, 2, and 11.  Add 1 + 2 + 11.  The sum, 14, is less than 22 and 22 is, therefore, defective.
Most numbers are defective because they have very few factors.  All prime numbers are defective.

Description: Mathematics, Measurement (includes Time), Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.)
Objective: Students learn how to compute perimeter and circumference.
Directions: Discuss with students the following facts.  Go over the sample problems as a class.
Facts to Know
Perimeter is the distance around all the edges of an object.
The distance around a property such as a house, lot, or a schoolyard is the perimeter of the property.
The following words usually indicate perimeter:  border, walls, fence, edges, sides, or distance around.
Perimeters of Rectangles
The perimeter of a rectangle can be computed by any of the following ways:
adding up all four sides of the rectangle
adding the length and width and multiplying by 2
using the formula:  P = (l + w) x 2  or  P = 2(l + w)
(Note:  P = perimeter, l = length, and w = width)
Compute the perimeter of this rectangle.  The length is 3.5 centimeters and the width is 2.4 centimeters.
Add the 3.5 plus 2.4, which equals 5.9 centimeters.  
Multiply by 2 to get the other two sides of the rectangle.  
The total perimeter is 11.8 centimeters.
Perimeters of Other Polygons


Add the sides of each polygon to compute the perimeter.
6.3 cm + 6.3 cm + 4.5 cm = 17.1 cm   7.3 cm x 5 = 36.5 cm
Circumference of a Circle
The formula for determining the circumference of a circle is 2πr or πd.  (To solve, multiply 2 times r (the radius) times π (equals to approximately 3.14) or multiply d (the diameter) times 3.14.
Multiply 5 times 2 times 3.14 or

Guess and Check
Your coach bought 7 balls.  The baseballs cost $3.98 and the basketballs cost $19.98.  The total cost was $75.86.  How many baseballs and how many basketballs did he buy?
You know:

the cost of each type of ball
the total cost
the number of balls purchased


You guess:

1 baseball ($3.98) plus 6 basketballs ($119.88) equals $123.86--too high
3 baseballs ($11.94) plus 4 basketballs ($79.92) equals $91.86--too high but closer
4 baseballs ($15.92) plus 3 basketballs ($59.94) equals $75.86--exactly right

You know:
Check:


 how much money he now has   
 $200.00 divided by half is $100.00   


 the fractional amount he spent each time   
 $100.00 divided by half is $50.00   




Work Backwards:

He has $50.00 now.
He had twice $50.00 ($100.00) before he spent half on advertising.
He had twice $100.00 ($200.00) before he spent half on cards.

Directions: Facts and Reminders
Roman Numerals
Roman numerals come from the Latin language and were used by the ancient Romans.  They are still used in the prefaces of some books, on public buildings, and in various other places.  Because the Romans lacked the concept of the empty space, the zero, these numerals can be difficult to add or subtract and require more symbols than decimal systems.
The Seven Basic Numerals
Seven capital letters stand for the basic symbols of the Roman number system.

Combining Roman Numerals
If a smaller number (one of lesser value) is placed before a larger number, that smaller number is subtracted from the larger number.



 IV   
 Placing I before the V is 5 minus 1, or 4.   


 IX   
 Placing I before the X is 10 minus 1, or 9.   




If a smaller number (one of lesser value) is placed after a larger number, that smaller number is added to the larger number.



 VI   
 Placing I after the V is 5 plus 1, or 6.   


 XII   
 Placing II after the X is 10 plus 2, or 12.

A factor is one of two or more numbers that are multiplied together.  The factors of 36 are the following:  (1, 36) (2, 18) (3, 12) (4, 9) (6, 6) or (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36).
The number 1 is always a factor of any number.
The number itself, such as 36, is always a factor.
A prime number is a counting number which has only 1 and itself for factors.  For example, 7 is a prime number because the only factors are 1 and 7.
A composite number is a counting number which has factors other than 1 and itself.  It has three or more factors.  For example, 12 is a composite number because the factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
Prime Factors and Prime Factorization
The prime factors of a number are all of the factors of a number which are prime numbers.  For example, the prime factors of 36 are 2 and 3.  You can use a factor tree to determine the prime factors of a number:
   36   /\  4  9 /\  /\2  2 3 3

Exponents can be used to express 36 as a product of prime factors.  The prime factorization of 36 is the following:  36 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 or 36 = 22 x 32
Algebraic Factors
An expression in algebra has slightly different terms for factors.  Letters are called literal factors.  Numbers are called numerical factors.
Sample A
Name the numerical and literal factors of this expression:  4abc.
Numerical factors:  (4) --- Literal factors:  (a, b, c)
Sample B
Name the numerical and literal factors of this expression:  2ab 9xy.
Numerical factors:  (2, 9) --- Literal factors:  (a, b, x, y)
Any factor or factors in an algebraic term is called the coefficient of the product of the remaining factors.
Sample A
Name the numerical and literal coefficients of this expression:  4abc.
Numerical coefficient:  (4) --- Literal coefficient:  (abc)
Sample B
Name the numerical and literal coefficients of this expression:  34xyz.
Numerical coefficient:  (34) --- Literal coefficient:  (xyz)
(Note:  In a term such as abx, where there is no number, the numerical coefficient is always 1.)

"Title: The Teenage Consumer
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Oral Language, Speaking, Mathematics, Data Analysis and Probability, Problem Solving
Objective: Students will participate in a group brainstorming and discussion session about teenage consumers and their spending habits.  They will then collect data about their own spending habits for comparison purposes.
Directions: 
The purpose of this lesson is to focus on the idea that teen consumers contribute a great deal to the U.S. economy.  Some industries rely heavily on teen markets for their sales and financial success.  
Begin by having students brainstorm in a large group.  This is the challenge you could pose to them.  Name specific items or industries that rely heavily on teenage consumers. 
As students contribute ideas, record them on the board for all to see.  Once ideas have been exhausted, move to the next part of the discussion.  
Focus on Scavenger Hunt questions 1-9.  These address the idea of teens as consumers.  Facilitate a short discussion about questions 3 and 4 and how the items and industries they have listed support the idea that some products are designed primarily for teens and that peer pressure urges teens to spend money on them.  
Finally, tell students they will be involved in an informal survey.  Hand out the Spending Log and go over the directions.  Explain that this will help them learn more about their own spending habits.

"Title: Time and Again
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Measurement (includes Time)
Objective: Students will learn about historical time and make time lines.
Directions: Historical Time
There are two main divisions of time--time roughly reckoned before and after the birth of Christ.  Most of the time in the ancient world is recorded as b.c. (before Christ).  Some books use b.c.e. (before the common era).  This time record counts backwards from the approximate date of Christ's birth until the earliest dates in recorded history.  The bigger the number named with b.c. or b.c.e., the further back in time the event occurred.  Numerical dates in b.c. become smaller as they approach the present so 44 b.c. is much closer to the present than 3500 b.c.  (The small c. is read ""circa"" and indicates an approximate date.)
Examples



 c.   
 2000   
 b.c.--Invention of the shadow clock   


 c.   
 100   
 b.c.--Birth of Julius Caesar   


 
 44   
 b.c.--Death of Julius Caesar   




The invention of the shadow clock about 2000 b.c. happened 1,900 years before the birth of Julius Caesar in 100 b.c.
a.d. or c.e.
a.d. (anno Domini) dates events from the approximate time of the birth of Christ.  Anno Domini is a Latin expression meaning ""in the year of Our Lord.""  The year 2000 a.d. is about 2,000 years since the birth of Christ.  The abbreviation c.e. (common era) means exactly the same time as a.d.  The year 2000 can be written as 2000 a.d. or 2000 c.e.  Some books use c.e. and others use a.d.  Numerical dates in a.d. (or c.e.) become larger so 1999 a.d. is much closer to the present than 
730 a.d.
Time Lines
Times lines are a way of illustrating the length of historical time.

Dates followed by b.c. descend from larger to smaller.  
There is no year 0. 
Dates followed by a.d. rise from smaller to larger.

"Title: Triangle Puzzler
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Geometry
Objective: Students are introduced to some basic concepts of geometry.
Directions: Introduce students to the properties of triangles.  The definition of a triangle is a figure with three sides, three angles, and three points.  Triangles can be named by using three points in their correct sequence.  For example, triangle ABC is a triangle with line segments drawn from A to B, B to C, and C to A.  Note the rule that the three points cannot be on the same line.
The angles in a triangle are measured by degrees.  A right angle measures 90 degrees.  Any angle less than a right angle is an acute angle.  Any angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.  An angle that is more than 180 degrees and less than 270 degrees is called an oblique angle.  This angle is not often used.
Triangles are named by the types of angles and sides they contain:
An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length and three angles of equal measure.  
An isocoles triangle has at least two sides with the same measure.  
A scalene triangle has no equal sides. 
A right triangle has one right angle (90 degrees).
An acute triangle has all angles less than 90 degrees.
An obtuse triangle has one angle greater than 90 degrees.
Have students use the first Triangle Puzzler activity sheet to identify different types of triangles.  They can use their knowledge to solve the puzzler on the second activity sheet.

Description: Mathematics, Operations (+, -, x, /, etc.), Problem Solving, Fractions
Objective: Students use basic operations of subtracting, adding, multiplying or dividing fractions, decimals, and percents to solve word problems.  They use this activity as a review of their fundamental skills.
Directions: Tell students that you will be going over the process of using basic operations to solve word problems.  Complete Samples A and B as a class.
Sample A
Mrs. King bought a dozen muffins for the students in her classroom.  If she bought, 1/2 of a dozen chocolate chip, 1/4 of a dozen apple cinnamon, and 1/4 dozen banana nut, how many of each muffin did she buy?
Hint:  Remember that 1 dozen muffins = 12 muffins
First, calculate what fraction of the 1 dozen muffins is of what variety.
1/2 dozen chocolate chip = 6 chocolate chip muffins
1/4 dozen apple cinnamon = 3 apple cinnamon muffins
1/4 dozen banana nut = 3 banana nut muffins
Then, add the different types of muffins and see if they add up to a dozen muffins.
6 chocolate chip + 3 apple cinnamon + 3 banana nut = 12 muffins
Sample B
Kenny and Kendra each received $10 to spend at the movies.  Kenny bought his ticket for $4.50 and then bought a small soda for $2.00 and popcorn for $2.50.  How much money did Kenny spend, and did he have any money left?  Kendra spent $4.50 for her ticket and then paid $1.75 for red licorice sticks and $2.00 for a small soda.  How much money did Kendra spend, and did she have any money left?



 Kenny   
 Kendra   



 First, add up all the money that Kenny spent at the movie theater. 
 $4.50 ticket
            $2.00 small soda
            + $2.50 popcorn
            -----
            $9.00 
 Next, subtract the total amount that Kenny spent from the $10 that he was given. 
 $10.00
            - $9.00
            -----
            $1.00
 So Kenny spent $9.00 at the theater and had $1.00 left. 


 Now, add up all the money that Kendra spent at the movie theater. 
 $4.50 ticket
            $1.75 red licorice
            $2.00 small soda
            -----
            $8.25 
 Next, subtract the total amount that Kendra spent from the $10 that she was given. 
 $10.00
            - $8.25
            -----
            $1.75 
 So Kendra spent $8.25 at the theater and had $1.75 left.

"Title: Word Problems: Algebra
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Algebra and Function, Problem Solving
Objective: Students will learn about solving word problems using simple algebra functions.
Directions: Many basic word problems can be expressed in an equation format, which makes it easy to understand and solve.
Using Algebraic Symbols
You can use a letter of the alphabet to represent the unknown number in a problem.  The equation is written so that the values on the left side of the equal sign equal the values on the right side of the equal sign.  Solve the equation so that the unknown value represented by a letter is alone on one side of the equal sign and the value of the unknown is on the other side of the equal sign.
Sample:  Jennifer has $25.00. She needs $49.00 to buy a new school outfit. How much more money does she need?  Write an equation this way:  n>/i> (money needed) + 25 (money she has) = 49 (cost of outfit);  Solve the equation by subtracting 25 from each side.  Jennifer needs $24.00 more.
n + 25 = 49
n + 25 - 25 = 49 - 25
n = 24
Axiom of Equality
The axioms of equality were used to help solve the basic equation above.  Any value added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided to one side of the equal sign must be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided respectively to the other side.
Sample:  A group of 5 girls decided to split evenly the $18.75 cost of a CD album by their favorite group.  How much money did each girl spend?  Write an equation.  Solve for n (the amount each girl spent) by dividing each side of the equation by 5.  Each girl spent $3.75.
5n  = $18.75
5n / 5 = $18.75 / 5
n = $3.75
Working with Two Unknown Quantities
You can use the same letter with an added or subtracted amount to represent two unknown quantities. Simplify and combine terms whenever possible. 
Sample:  Sammy's mother is 2 years more than 3 times as old as Sammy.  Their combined age is 42.  How old are Sammy's mother and Sammy?  Write an equation where n equals Sammy's age.  Let 3n + 2 = Sammy's mother's age.  Since the total of their ages equals 42, then n + 3n + 2 = 42;  Then combine the terms:  4n + 2 = 42;  Use the axioms of equality by subtracting 2 and then dividing by 4. Sammy is 10 years old. His mother is 32 years old.
4n + 2  = 42 
4n + 2 - 2  =  42 - 2 
4n  = 40 
4n / 4  =  40 / 4
n  = 10

"Title: Word Problems: Geometry
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Geometry, Problem Solving
Objective: Students will learn how to use basic geometry to solve word problems
Directions: Perimeter
Perimeter is the length around a closed shape.  It is computed by adding the length of all the sides of the figure.  The formula for finding the perimeter of rectangles and other parallelograms is P = (l + w) x 2  or  P = 2 l + 2 w
Area
The area of a flat surface is a measure of how much space is covered by that surface.  Area is measured in square units.  
Area of a Rectangle
The area of a rectangle is computed by multiplying the width of one side times the length of the adjoining side (A = l x w). The area of a rectangle can also be determined by multiplying the base times the height (A = b x h).
Area of a Triangle
A triangle is always one half of a rectangle or a parallelogram.  The area of a triangle is computed by multiplying 1/2 of the base times the height of a triangle (A = 1-2 b x h)
Area of a Parallelogram
The area of a parallelogram is computed by multiplying the base times the height (A = b x h).
Area of a Circle
To find the area of a circle, multiply π (3.14) times the radius times the radius again (A = π r2).
Circumference 
The circumference is the distance around a circle.  To find the circumference of a circle, multiply π (which always equals 3.14) times the diameter or multiply 2 times π (3.14) times the radius (C = π d  or  C = 2 π r).
Volume
The formula for finding the volume of a rectangular prism, such as a box, is to multiply the length times the width times the height   (V = l x w x h).  
The formula for finding the volume of a cylinder is to multiply π (3.14) times the radius squared times the height  (V = π x r2 x h ).
Volume is always computed in cubic units.  Use cubic inches or centimeters when determining volume for small prisms and cylinders, and cubic feet or meters for larger ones.

"Title: Working with Algebraic Expressions
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Algebra and Function
Objective: Students learn about the basics of algebraic expressions.
Directions: Introduce to students the following information about algebraic expressions.
Facts to Know
Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses numbers and letters that stand for numbers to solve problems.  In algebra, if a number is unknown, any letter of the alphabet can be used to stand for that number.  Letters are called variables because the values of the letters vary from one problem to another.  In one problem, x may stand for -2.  In another problem, it may stand for 43.
Writing Algebraic Expressions
An algebraic expression is a statement made up of numbers, variables, and signs of operation 
(+, -, ÷, x).  The phrase ""a number"" indicates the use of the variable.

Combining Like Terms
Sometimes algebraic expressions can be shortened by combining like terms making them simpler to understand.  An expression is made up of smaller parts called terms.  A term can be made up of numbers, variables, or numbers and variables.  In an expression, terms are separated by only plus and minus signs.
Examples: 15, x, xy, 5xy, 4x/y
A numerical coefficient is any number in front of a variable in a term. If there is no number in front of a varible, the numerical coefficient is understood to be 1.

An exponent tells how many times a number has been multiplied by itself.  Examples: 42, 8w3, 10n3
Terms that have all of the same variables (xy, 3xy, 5xy, etc.) or variables with the same exponents (4a2 + a2), are called like or similar terms.  Like terms can be combined by combining the numerical coefficients.

But an algebraic expression like  9y2 + 2y cannot be combined because y2 and 2y are not like terms.  One has an exponent of 2 and the other has a coefficient of 2.
Evaluating Algebraic Expressions
Remember that in algebra a variable can stand for any number.  However, sometimes in an algebraic expression, you are given the value of the letter.  Then you must replace the variables with the numbers they represent to solve for the value of the whole expression.

"Title: Arctic Food Web
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students create food webs for animals in the arctic.
Directions: Discuss with students the fact that living things need food in order to survive.  A food chain shows how living things need each other for food.  A green plant is usually found at the bottom of a food chain.  The plant uses energy from the sun to carry on a process called photosynthesis.  This allows the plant to produce its own food.  As a result, the plant in a food chain is called a producer.
The producer, or plant, is eaten by an animal that is a herbivore, which is an animal that eats only plants, or an omnivore, which is an animal that eats plants and other animals.  On the food chain, the animal that eats the producer is called a consumer.  This is because it consumes the producer.
In the next part of a food chain, the consumer is eaten by another animal that is a carnivore, which is an animal that eats only meat, or an omnivore.  This animal is also called a consumer.
Here is an example of a food chain.  Notice that the arrows start with the producer and point toward the consumers.
Producer --> Consumer --> Consumer
(Grass) --> (Grasshopper) --> (Bird)
There are many food chains living in a community.  Some are very simple, while others are more complex.  Since most animals eat more than one type of food, they might have several different food chains that can be made.  When food chains connect or overlap, it is called a food web.  If one part of the food web becomes extinct, the entire web may be affected, causing drastic consequences.
Write these examples of food webs on the board:
Snowy Owl --> Lemming --> Plants
Snowy Owl --> Arctic Hare --> Plants
Snowy Owl --> Ground Squirrel --> Plants
Ask students if they can create a food web that begins with humans.  Have them write some possible webs on the board.  Discuss what we are dependant on in order to survive.

"Title: Earth's Journey Through Space
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will manipulate models to demonstrate the Earth's motions as it travels through space.
Directions: Preparation
Enlarge pictures of Earth's Journey Models beginning with the solar system as the smallest and the universe as the largest.
Copy Earth's Journey Cue Cards on card stock and cut them apart.
Clear bulletin board space for the display of the Earth's Journey Models.
Stick a small cardboard cutout of a person on the globe at your location and another at the equator on the other side of the Earth.
Place the light in the center of the room and clear away as much furniture as possible to permit freedom of movement around the room.
Procedure
Select six students to assist in showing the Earth's journey through space.  Distribute the Earth's Journey Cue Cards and corresponding props to the six students.  Let them become familiar with their part in the demonstration and then assemble the class near the light to observe.
Turn on the light (sun) and turn off the room lights.  Have the first two students demonstrate steps 1 and 2.
Turn the light on and have the remaining four students complete the demonstration, using the bulletin board to attach their props as explained on the cue cards.
As each student finishes his/her explanation, mount his/her cue card on the appropriate place on the display and link each picture to the next with string to show the position of our solar system. 
Have students complete the data sheet How Fast Are You Traveling?
For Discussion
Discuss the data sheet to check the Earth's speed calculations.
Tell the students to sit still and then ask them why they can't really do this on Earth.  Have them compare the Earth's motion with riding in a car or airplane.  If they look out the windows, it appears as if the ground is moving.  Explain that even though Earth is moving rapidly, it is so huge that we feel no motion.  It appears that the sun and stars are moving, but actually this is caused by Earth's motion.  Astronomers use powerful telescopes to discover the motions of galaxies.

"Title: Hello, Is Anybody Out There?
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will design a message describing our planet and solar system to be sent into space to intelligent life beyond our solar system and galaxy.
Directions: Background
Recent searches have discovered a planetary system around a distant star.  Most scientists believe that there are many other planetary systems in the universe.  Some of these may have planets with intelligent life forms.  The vast distances between our planetary system and others prevent our traveling there in present-day spacecraft.  Radio waves traveling at the speed of light can be sent and received by radio telescopes.  Earthbound scientists sent a message from Earth in 1974 via a gigantic radio telescope located in Puerto Rico.  They also use radio telescopes to listen for any radio waves which may be sent by intelligent life.  Thus far, no messages have been received.  Even at the speed of light, these messages need to travel thousands of years to reach their destinations.
Another way of communicating to these distant locations is to attach messages in the form of pictures and sound to satellites launched to outlying planets in our solar system.  Such messages have been sent aboard the Voyagers 1 and 2 and Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft that went to the outer planets. These satellites are now on their way out of the solar system and may, even thousands of years from now, encounter a life form which can ""read"" our messages.
Preparation
Place pictures of our solar system on the bulletin board and books on display for easy access.
Procedure
Divide the students into scientific teams and distribute Space Messages sheets to them.
For Discussion
Scientific teams should read and discuss the information sheet.
Each team should develop a plan for creating their message.  They should be encouraged to use electronic devices such as video cameras, tape recorders and computers.
Follow Up
Let the scientific teams exchange data sheets and attempt to decipher another team's message.

"Title: Hot Chocolate Testing
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Mathematics, Data Analysis and Probability, Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students scientifically compare and contrast various brands of hot chocolate.
Directions: Once you have purchased the hot chocolate mixes, remove the labels from each container.  Then use permanent marker to indicate on both the container and the removed label whether it is drink A, B, C, or D.  If you purchased a drink mix whose label cannot be removed, use your copy machine to make a replica of the label and then cover the container with opaque paper. 
Cut from each label the nutritional facts section and mount each of these on a square of tagboard.  Make sure the product name does not appear anywhere on these cards.  You may want to make three or four copies of each nutritional fact card.  Display these cards around the classroom on the day of the experiment.  Students will need this information to complete the first part of the lab.
Use approximately 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of powder per Styrofoam cup.  The students may do this themselves or you may find it more accurate and time saving to do this yourself ahead of time.  Then fill each cup half full of hot water.
One large or two to three small coffee maker(s) filled with warmed water will be enough to handle approximately 20-25 experiments.  If you have more than one class, you will need to refill and heat the water at a constant rate.
Warning: The water only needs to be very warm for this experiment.  Extremely hot water could be dangerous in the classroom.
Make sure that students know the meaning of the word residue.  You may have to define it for them.
Some students may be allergic to chocolate.  Be sure to identify these before the taste testing.  If a student is not able to participate, assign a partner to him or her who will share his or her findings for the remainder of this activity.
Distribute the three Hot Chocolate Testing lab sheets to students and have them begin the experiment.
Resources: 
, four different varieties of hot chocolate drinks (30 to 40 oz. of each drink mix should be enough to accommodate 100 students), 
, four Styrofoam cups per student,

"Title: How Do We Breathe?
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Life Science
Objective: Students will learn more about the structure of the lungs and experiment to measure the amount of air in their lungs.
Directions: Lesson Preparation
For each group prepare a tray of materials: a container of bubble solution, straws, file cards for each member, and a ruler.
This activity must be done indoors to prevent the wind from breaking the bubbles.
Activity

Have students use the lung models to tell what they have learned about lungs and how much air their lungs will hold.
Use the transparency The Lungs to show students what their lungs look like and learn more about their function.
Show students the sponge and explain that lungs look much like a sponge.  Pass the sponge around so students can see how light it is.  Cut it in half to show that the holes are throughout the sponge.  Let students know that these are really air sacs in the sponge, not holes, and that their lungs have these as well.  Place one half the sponge in the water and let them see that it floats until water enters the air sacs, forces out the air, and makes the sponge so heavy that it begins to sink.
Tell students that they are going to see how much air their lungs can hold.  Divide students into small groups and give each group a tray of bubble materials.  Let each student write his or her name on a file card and then write 1, 2, and 3 at the beginning of the first three lines.  Have them remove all items from the tray and pour about a tablespoon (15 mL) of bubble solution on the tray.  They should spread it around with their hands to make the entire surface wet with the solution.
Show them how to dip one end of a straw into the bubble solution and blow a bubble through it.  After they have been successful, show them how to take a very deep breath and this time blow the biggest bubble they can on the surface of the tray.  When the bubble pops, use a ruler to measure its diameter and write it on a file card.  Do this until three trials have been completed.  Tell all the group members to take turns blowing one bubble and then repeat this until three trials have been made.

Closure 

Tell the students to circle the measurement of the largest bubble they blew.  Use this data to help students see how to construct a graph.  Distribute a small self-adhesive note to each student and have each write his or her name and bubble size on it.
Ask the students to tell you their bubble sizes.  Find the largest and smallest bubbles.  Project the transparency of the Graph of Air Exhaled from the Lungs on the board.  Write the bubble sizes in order from smallest to largest on the horizontal axis.
Have each student place his or her note on the line which represents the size of that bubble.  Ask the students to help you count the notes for each measurement and then complete the vertical axis.
Let students have the experience of analyzing this data by asking them the following:
    
What was the largest bubble size?
What was the smallest bubble size?
What was the size of the bubble most of the students blew?  (Explain that this was the average-size bubble for the class.)


Tell the students your largest bubble size and compare it with the size of theirs.  (The teacher's bubble should be larger.)  Find the bubble measurements for the tallest students in the class and see if they blew larger bubbles than the shortest students.
Explain to the students that our lungs grow as we grow and the bigger we are, the larger our lungs become.  Therefore, if their lungs did not hold as much air as someone else's did, they may have smaller lungs.  Tell them also that we can never squeeze out all the air in our lungs.

"Title: Invent a. . .
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students attempt to turn ordinary materials into inventions which are useful in solving a problem.
Directions: Preparation:

Make sets of materials for students to use in creating an invention as shown on the work sheets.  The sets will be duplicated so that two teams will work with the same set of materials to see if they can use them in a different way.
Prepare a table containing items all groups may borrow during their work.


Procedure:

Briefly discuss what students have learned about inventing.  Be sure they know that inventions often come about because there is a problem which needs to be solved.  Also, inventors need to be creative and look at using materials in different ways than most people would in order to turn them into new inventions.
Explain that the students will be divided into teams.  Tell them that each team will be challenged to use a set of materials for inventing a specific type of item.  Let them know that each invention task will be done by two different teams.  The challenge will be that each team must make a different invention from the same set of materials.
Divide the students into six teams and distribute the work sheets.  Let each team read the instructions.  Be sure the pairs of teams working on the same task are separated in the room and do not exchange ideas.
Show the students where in the room the general team materials are located.
Distribute the sets of materials to the teams.  Instruct them to examine and discuss these before they begin the task.  Without giving them any ideas, monitor their progress and offer them encouragement to be creative.


Closure: 

Have students show their inventions and demonstrate how they work.
Place the inventions on display in the classroom, along with the work sheet for each team.

"Title: It's a Matter of Space
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Physical Science
Objective: Students conduct an experiment in which they prove that two kinds of matter cannot take up the same space at the same time.
Directions: Have two students come to the front of the room and play musical chairs with one chair.  Ask the class what happened when they both tried to take up the same space at the same time.
Have a team come up to form a liquid molecule shape (standing slightly apart, holding hands).  Have another team come up and huddle like a solid molecule shape.  Ask them to enter the ""liquid"" molecule team.  The liquid molecules will have to spread apart to let them in.
Remind students that one of the two things which are true for all kinds of matter is that matter takes up space.  They just saw that when two students try to take up the same space at the same time, one of them has to leave.
Today they will do an experiment in which they investigate what happens when two kinds of matter try to take up the same space at the same time.  In this experiment, they will need to carefully measure, using both a measuring cup and a ruler.
Review measuring procedures, pointing out that when using a measuring cup they must first be certain that they are using the correct measuring cup, then, that the cup is filled to the top.  If they spill what is in the cup they will need to remeasure.
Demonstrate setting the #1 cm end of a ruler on the table next to a cup and reading the measurement next to a line on the cup.
Discuss and demonstrate that to determine how much space matter took up, they will need to first measure the water in a cup before any matter is added, then measure the water after the matter is added.  They will then need to subtract the first measurement from the second in order to see how much space was taken up.
Have students use the following procedure to complete the experiment.

Discuss the question.  Thinking about what you have observed around you and learned in class, make a team hypothesis.  Write it on your experiment sheet.
Follow the procedure steps on your experiment sheet.  Be certain to check off each step as you do it.  Complete your data-capture sheet as you work.
Write the results of your experiment, telling what you actually saw happening.  Talk about the materials you used in the experiment.
Discuss the conclusion.  Remember that you are trying to answer the experiment question.  Be sure that you have a because statement in the conclusion, and talk about the molecules.

Extensions

Have students do a Writing to Inform exercise.  Ask them to explain to a student in another class what they did in this experiment, using sequence words, and tell what they discovered.
Put a hole in the bottom of a large empty juice can.  Place the can upside down in a bucket of water, having students place their hands near the hole.  As water enters the can, they will feel air rushing out of the can.  As the water enters the space inside the can, it pushes the air which was there out, since they both cannot take up the same space at the same time.
Try two short experiments to show that ice takes up more space than water:  1) Fill a bottle to the top with water and make a loose fitting cap out of aluminum foil.  Put the bottle in the freezer until the contents are frozen.  The ice will expand, pushing the top off.  The molecules in ice have a different configuration than the molecules in water.  2) Float an ice cube in a glass of water that is almost full.  Have students watch what happens to the water line as the ice melts.


Closure

Discuss the experiment hypotheses, results, and conclusions.  Examine the team charts to make certain that all the teams got the same measurements for the first step of each part of the experiment.  Everyone should have the same cm measurement for 1/2 cup (125 mL) of water, every time.  The experiment results will be affected if the measurements weren't properly taken.
Discuss the fact that the solids and liquids were carefully measured, but there was no way to carefully measure gas, so that the experiment cannot fully compare a gas with the liquid and solid.
Have students make a science journal entry: ""Two kinds of matter cannot stay in the same space at the same time.""

"Title: Mission to Mars:  The Journey Begins
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Fluency, Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will participate in a simulated trip in 2025 aboard a supersonic transporter carrying them from Earth to a space station orbiting Earth at an altitude of 146 miles.
Directions: Suggestions for the Simulation
This simulation will transport the students to the Freedom Space Station which is in orbit around the Earth in this future time period.  Realism can be added to this simulation through the use of pictures taken by astronauts while orbiting the Earth.  If slides or videos are used, they can be viewed on a screen made to look like a giant porthole through which all passengers can see the views.  Uniforms may be easily made by the students, using disposable overalls.
There are eight speaking parts in the simulation: captain, first officer, two flight attendants, two passengers, air traffic controller (tower), and a space station porter.  These roles may be played by either male or female students.  Consider placing students in non-traditional roles, such as females for captain and first officer and males as flight attendants.
Preparation

Highlight each script for one of the eight roles.  Keep the extra script to give cues as needed.
Distribute scripts to students who will play the eight roles.  The remainder of the class will be passengers on board this flight.
Set up the classroom for the simulation.  Assign specific locations for the tower, transporter, and space station.  Include areas for the flight deck and passengers inside the transporter and one cabin within the space station.
Create props for the simulation, such as flight control panels and special seats for the captain and first officer.  Let students help with this task to make the interior of the transporter.
Make a porthole area to show views of Earth by using slides or a video.
Make uniforms for the flight crew, including insignias of their company.  (Suggestion: Obtain from a paint store disposable overalls which can be decorated for each crew member.)


Procedure

Let the cast read over their script to become familiar with it.
Conduct the simulation with the cast of players reading their scripts.


Discussion
Let students discuss additions they can make to the script, such as more passenger conversations or problems with a near collision with another space transporter.
Follow Up
Let students perform the simulation as a skit for other classes.

"Title: Off to the Future
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will learn that the California coastline west of the San Andreas Fault will change drastically over the next 50 million years as the Pacific Plate continues to slowly move north.
Directions: Background
As the Pacific Plate moves north relative to the North American Plate, it carries with it the part of California located west of the San Andreas Fault, including Baja California.  Many scientists believe this section will eventually break away from the North American continent and be pushed towards Alaska.
Preparation

"Title: Plate Tectonics
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will be introduced to the topic of Earth's crustal plates and how their motion has changed the surface features we see today.
Directions: Background
Scientists have gathered evidence which shows that the Earth's crust is broken into sections, much like the cracked shell of a hard-boiled egg.  The crust is actually very thin compared to the rest of the Earth.  If the shell were removed from the hard-boiled egg and the egg sprayed with paint, the thin layer of the paint would closely resemble the depth of the crust relative to the internal sections of the planet.
When equipment made it possible to map the ocean floor and dive to the great depths, another world opened to scientists.  High ridges and deep trenches were discovered on the ocean floor.  Molten lava was seen pouring from cracks in the ocean floor.  This added to the knowledge of the Earth's crust and helped support the theory of Continental Drift.  The crust is constantly being recycled as new, molten material rises through cracks and pushes aside old material before solidifying.
Edges of some of the crustal plates are diving beneath others, creating earthquakes and volcanic activity.  An example of this is the Pacific Plate.  The collision of these plates also causes uplifting of mountain ranges.  This can be seen along the western edge of South America as the Nazca Plate pushes under the South America Plate, lifting up the Andes Mountain range along the coastline.
As a plate dives beneath another, it begins to melt down when it comes in contact with the hotter mantle lying under the crust.  The result of all this is the slow but continuous recycling of the Earth's crust, continents relocating, and mountains rising.
Preparation

Make copies of Earth's Plates Puzzle and cut the pieces apart.  Put the pieces for each puzzle in a separate envelope.  Make a transparency of this page and cut them apart.
Hard-boil an egg, crack the shell in several places, and then outline the edges of these cracks with permanent black-felt pen.
Display the maps in the classroom.


Procedure

Show the students the hard-boiled egg with the cracked shell.  Explain how it is like the crust of the Earth (see Background).
Show the students The Earth's Fractured Surface map.  Point out the ridges and trenches in the ocean floor which form the boundaries of the crustal plates.
Use the background information from page 68 to describe what happens as these plates push against each other.
Divide the students into small groups and give each group an envelope with the Earth's Plates Puzzle pieces.  Have them put the puzzle together, using a world map to assist them.
Distribute the data sheet to each group for them to complete.
Provide for the students reference books which will help them answer the information on the data sheet.

"Title: Retrograde Motion of Mars
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will plot the path of Mars through the constellations.
Directions: Background
Ancient astronomers (astrologers) mapped the positions of planets moving gradually through zodiac constellations.  They saw that planets moved across the sky from east to west each day.  However, they also slipped eastward throughout the year.  Since astronomers believed the planets were traveling around Earth, they assumed the paths would always move eastward, like the sun.  What they observed was very different.  The planets did move eastward, but from time to time they would slow down, stop, and then begin moving westward.  Gradually, they would slow down again until they stopped and resumed their eastward motion again.  Thus, they appeared to be making loops in their paths.  The loops varied in size with each planet, and not every planet was looping at the same time.  This was finally explained by the theory that the planets were traveling around Earth within their own circular orbits, called epicycles.  Later, it was proved that the planets revolve around the sun, not Earth.  Now, a different explanation for this backwards, or retrograde, motion was needed.  
Mars will be used as the example in this activity to show students what the retrograde loop looks like when plotted against the constellations and why we see this happening.

Make transparencies of Mars Motion in 1971 and Explaining Retrograde Motion.  Cut and assemble the latter according to the instructions.
Show the transparency of Mars Motion in 1971.  Read the information about the diagram.
Have students refer to drawing and chart to answer the following questions:



(Trace the path of Mars from #1 to #13.) Look at the path.  What is the direction of Mars from #1 position to #4? (eastward)
Describe what happened after that.  (The planet began to move westward after #5 until #9 when it began to move eastward again.)
Was there any change in Mars' appearance at this time? (Yes, it increased in size from #1 to its largest size on August 11 at position #7.  It then began to become smaller)
What happened to its brightness? (Mars became brighter as it grew in size and then dimmer as it reduced in size.)
Why would Mars change in size and brightness? (As it gets closer to Earth, it would appear to increase in size and brightness.)


Show the students the transparency of Explaining Retrograde Motion of Mars.  Point out the orbits of Mars and Earth are not centered on the sun.  Show that Mars takes longer than 12 months to make one complete trip around the sun.  Place a finger from each hand on the position 1 for both planets.  Rotate Earth's orbit, keeping your fingers moving to 2.  As you do this for all positions, pause to analyze the distances and direction of Mars.  Notice that Mars appears to lag behind Earth (retrograde) from 4 until 10, after which Mars begins to catch up with Earth again.  
Have the students find where Mars appears brightest (4 or 5).  Dimmest (12).

"Title: Sky Pictures
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Science, Earth and Space Science
Objective: Students will learn about constellations and how we can see them from Earth.
Directions: Constellation Activities
(The Young Astronomer, pages 25-30); (The Visual Dictionary of the Universe, pages 15-17)  Several activities in The Young Astronomer help students study the night sky. These include making a quadrant or simple sextant to determine latitude (page 27) and a device to show the positions of the sun, Earth, and zodiac constellations (pages 28 and 29). There is also an activity for creating a model of the constellation Cygnus (the Swan or Northern Cross) on page 30. Both books have excellent constellation maps.
Background
Constellations (pages 61 and 62) are images of human and animal figures in the sky, using stars like dot-to-dot pictures. Most of these were designed over 2,000 years ago, spread symmetrically around a point above Earth's North Pole. Today Polaris (the North Star) is over the Pole, but that was not so then. As Earth rotates on its axis, it wobbles like a top so that the north axis pole moves in a circular motion over a 26,000-year period. This changes the locations of constellations.
The 12 zodiac constellations are located along the ecliptic, the path the sun appears to follow as Earth revolves around it. The moon and planets also follow this path and are seen against the band of zodiac constellations. Astronomy had its beginnings in astrology, a belief that human behavior was controlled by the motion of the planets, sun, and moon within zodiac constellations. We know now that there is no connection between how these celestial bodies move and what happens to anyone on Earth. But astrologers carefully recorded the changing locations of these bodies, and this valuable data later helped astronomers understand more about the motions of planets.
The sun's position within zodiac constellations is different today. Along with the wobble of Earth, the planet does not return to exactly the same location in its orbit at the same time each year. Thus, the sun gradually moves into the next zodiac constellation. The months when the sun is in each zodiac constellation (pages 61 and 62) do not match the dates in horoscopes, but are astronomically correct for the present time.
The zodiac and other constellations serve as useful maps of the sky, helping us locate planets, comets, and other celestial bodies. Monthly constellation charts can help students locate patterns in the sky and find the planets moving among these star patterns.
Activity: simulating the sun's path through the zodiac constellations
Materials: zodiac constellations (pages 61 and 62), overhead projector, 12 sheets of large black construction paper, chalk or white marker, clamp-on light with 150-watt bulb
Lesson Preparation

Make transparencies of the zodiac constellations. Project them onto the large black paper individually; use the white marker to trace the stars (dots) and lines. The sizes of the dots denote brightness, not size. The larger dots are brighter stars.
Include the constellation name, when the sun is there, and when it is seen.
Use a large room for this lesson. Using a string four feet (122 cm) long with a loop at one end and a piece of chalk tied to the other, make a circle in the center of the floor. Have someone hold the loop of the string in the center of the floor, stretch out the string, and use the chalk to draw the circle. Shorten the string to 2.5 feet (76 cm) and draw another circle within the first, using the same center point. Place the lamp in the center of these circles at the students' eye level.


Procedure

Share the background information about the zodiac constellations, using the transparencies to enable students to see what they look like.
Take the students to a large room. Have 12 students hold the zodiac pictures. Have them spread out equally around the large circle. The constellations should be in order of the numbers, moving in a clockwise direction around the circle.
Have the remaining students stand around the inner circle, facing the constellations. Turn on the bright light and turn off the room lights. Tell students that the bright light is the sun and they are the Earth. Have them spin slowly in their positions in a counterclockwise direction (west to east) to simulate day and night. Day is when they face the sun (light), night when they face away from the light and see the stars.
Explain that if they could go north out beyond the solar system, they would see the Earth move around the sun in a counterclockwise direction. Let them begin to walk slowly in a counterclockwise direction around the circle, looking at the constellations as they do so. Point out that these change as they move. Explain that from Earth we see new constellations gradually appearing in the eastern sky, as those in the west gradually disappear below the western horizon. It takes 12 months to get back to the original set of constellations. Have them walk all the way around the circle, mentally marking the constellation they see at the beginning, and stopping there after walking around the circle. Explain that they have just gone through one year.
Have students collect on one side of the light, face towards it, and try to see the constellations opposite it. Explain that the sun is so bright we can't see the stars beyond it. Tell the students that the 12 zodiac constellations correspond to the location of the sun during each of the 12 months. When the sun is ""in"" one of them (e.g., Leo), we can't see the constellation. Only when we go into space, where sunlight is not scattered by Earth's atmosphere, can we see the stars and sun together. Even then, some of the stars near the sun are hard to see due to its bright light. We can catch glimpses of bright stars and planets during a total solar eclipse, when we can see beyond our atmosphere.
Explain that planets and our moon move around the sun on a plane, like a huge dinner plate with the sun in the center. The zodiac constellations lie beyond this plane, appearing roughly east to west across Earth's sky. The planets, moon, and sun never appear in the sky north or south of this band of stars.
Review the zodiac constellations and look closely at the figures these star patterns are supposed to represent. Ask students which ones most resemble the pictures. These are Leo, (lion), Scorpio (scorpion), and Taurus (bull--face and horns only).
Make enlarged copies of some of these constellations without the lines for the students to make their own constellations. Have them use the patterns of the stars (dots) to turn them into pictures of things familiar to them.
Have students research the legends connected with constellations. These may be found at the Web site below. Click on Star Myths to reach links to a wide variety of legends about various constellations and planets.

"Title: Writing an Autobiographical Incident
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Journaling
Objective: Students write autobiographical stories.
Directions: In this activity, students write about a personal experience that is significant and memorable.  Often this will explain how they became involved with an interest, hobby, or subject.  Included in this, they are to describe a scene which will include remembered feelings, reflections, and relationships.  Students will specifically explain about the chosen events that have led up to the significance of their magazine choice.
Have students define autobiography.  Students will usually want to volunteer openly and share events in their lives that led up to their magazine choice.  Encourage them to share information about their hobbies.  Include all discussion, which should generate many student ideas.
Using the brief student sample provided on page 128 (Notice the challenge section following the sample) or an autobiography that has been read by the class, read aloud and discuss why this particular autobiography was written.
Ask students to identify the key elements of their autobiographies that should be included in their writing.
Sample Key Autobiographical Elements

Remembering childhood events
Being taught by someone
Learning something by doing
Learning something by reading about it and following the directions
Participating in a competition
Being involved in family tradition
Learning at school and desiring to excel
Participating in a popular activity or trend that many students enjoy


Hand out the autobiographical incident prewriting guide on page 127 as an outline for students.  Using the overhead projector or the chalkboard, write a topic sentence about a specific interest.  Show how to use sequence as the students start writing about the beginning of their theme.  Walk the students through the steps of writing an autobiography without using the word ""then"" to begin each sentence.  (Devote a few minutes to suggesting other transitional words and phrases that show sequence.)  The conclusion should express some thoughts about the future impact this hobby and/or interest will have on the writer.  After the students have completed their notes in the prewriting guide, they should write the rough drafts in their spiral notebooks.
Continue to model proofreading.  Encourage vivid language and action verbs.

"Title: By Jove, I Think You've Got It
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Oral Language, Listening
Objective: A light bulb is used creatively to highlight student writing.
Directions: 
As a class, brainstorm a list of problems involving the environment (for example, the hole in the ozone layer, deforestation of the rain forests, poaching of endangered species, etc.).
Hold a class vote to select the problem the students most wish to write about.  Write the chosen problem on the board.
In small groups, allow the students to brainstorm for solutions to the problem.  Each group should think of at least three solutions.
Individually, each student will write a problem and solution essay, using the problem the class chose and one of the three or more solutions the small group suggested.
After each student has written a first draft, have them return to their small groups for responses to  their writing.  Each report should be attached to a separate sheet of paper; and, as the report is passed to each person of the group, that person will write comments and suggestions on the attached paper.  The group's work will be finished when every report has been read and responded to by every member of the group.
Each student should edit and revise the report, keeping the group's responses in mind.
Distribute page 89 to each student.  Tell the students to use this form for the final drafts of their reports.  (Each student may need more than one copy.)  The students should cut around the forms.
Cut out the patterns on pages 90 and 91.  Attach them together to make a light bulb.  Display the light bulb on a bulletin board.  Then stack the students reports to make the socket part of the bulb.  Staple them together across the top and attach them in place to the bulb.  On the light bulb, write the original problem from the board.

"Title: Clauses
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Grammar
Objective: Students learn about and practice using clauses.
Directions: Introduction
A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate.  The subject of a clause may be expressed or understood. 
There are two types of clauses.
(a)
A main clause (independent clause) contains the main thought of the sentence and makes sense standing alone.
Examples:  I spoke to the teacher who is our football coach.
The dog that was barking chased me across the lawn.
(b)
A subordinate clause (dependent clause) cannot make sense standing on its own.  To make a sentence, a subordinate clause must be added to a main clause.
Examples:  I saw the dog when I came home.
They went to the store so they could buy ice cream.
Subordinate clauses add information to a sentence and function in the same way as adjectives, adverbs, or nouns.
Examples:
The woman who received the prize is my mother.  (adjective)
Our class stops working when the bell rings.  (adverb)
I think that we should always do the right thing.  (noun)
Sentences are analyzed by finding and naming the clauses.
(a)
Simple sentences consist of one clause.
Example: 
Horses run.
(b) Complex sentences have more than one subject-verb combination and thus have more than one clause.  A complex sentence has at least one main clause and one or more subordinate clauses.  A subordinate clause is introduced by a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun.
Example:  I was resting while he was swimming laps.
(c)
Compound sentences consist of two or more main clauses (independent clauses) joined by a conjunction.
Example:  I washed the dishes, and Billy dried them.
Teaching Strategies
The main thing 
Provide students with practice in finding the main clause in a sentence by having them search through a photocopy of a familiar story, circling the main clauses. Remind them that a main clause can stand alone and contains the main thought of the sentence.  Point out that a simple sentence is, in fact, one main clause.
Main clause beep
Have children sit in a circle.  Choose a child to say a word to start a clause.  Each child in turn then adds a word to build a main clause.  When the clause is complete, the next child says ""Beep.""  The game can be extended to add a subordinate clause to the main clause.
Act the clause 
Organize children in groups of four.  Tell groups that the first child is to provide a verb, the second child is to provide a subject, the third child is to arrange the verb and subject to make a clause, and the fourth child is to act out the clause.  Ensure that all children get a turn in each role.
Clause match-up 
Have children match main clauses to subordinate clauses.  This is also an excellent reading activity.



 These are the brave boys   
 because he was feeling ill.   


 Bill did not come   
 where the bus stop was.   


 The bus driver didn't know   
 who rescued the drowning child.   




Clause call-out 
Write a main clause on the chalkboard and challenge children to call out appropriate subordinate clauses.



 We went to the park   
 when we had eaten lunch.   


 
 where the banana tree grows.   


 
 because we wanted to play.   




Verb search 
Write some clauses on the chalkboard.  Have children search for and identify the verb in each clause.
I saw the boy who broke the glass.
Add the verb
Have children orally add missing verbs to clauses.
I saw the boy who ten goals.
I saw the boy who kicked ten goals.
The police arrested the thief who the jewels.
The police arrested the thief who stole the jewels.

"Title: Comic Book Project
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing, Art, Mediums, Techniques
Objective: Students will write a fictional story creating a conflict and resolution, applying sequential writing, using action verbs, descriptive language, and onomatopoeia, in a comic book format with original artwork and/or technology.
Directions: Before the project begins, have students bring in comic books, daily comics, and Sunday comics.  Read them aloud.  Ask the students why comic books have never lost popularity.  Discuss the different kinds of comics written, subject matter, and the purpose of comics.  Ask the students if some comic strips or comic books continue with a daily sequence of events with problems and solutions.  Cite examples of comics that fill those requirements.  Discuss how comic strips can turn into comic books.  Explain to the students their assignment will be to create a comic book using imaginary characters that find a solution to a problem.  Use this project to encourage the theme of the enjoyment of recreational reading.

Students choose the dimensions of the size of their pictures.  Each page must have at least four to six panels with related captions.
Explain that each panel size for the comic book picture must be the same for each page.  
Require that onomatopoetic words such as bang, boom, crash, clang, buzz, whoosh, swish, creak, eek, etc., be used occasionally.
Read the student check-off list aloud to clarify all requirements.  Writing the comic strips for each page must precede the artwork and graphics.  Excessive violence, weapons, and blood are unacceptable.  This project is rated for a general audience.
Brief student conferences on each student's rough draft should be held to facilitate complete sentence structure, descriptive adjectives, and action verb usage.  Peer editing during this project combines reading enjoyment and student affirmation with skill development.
The final due date provides the students with a day to read each other's creations.  This day fills the classroom with recreational reading and a positive climate for further emphasis on writing for entertainment.

"Title: Complex Sentences Made Easy
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Grammar
Objective: Students learn about complex sentences.
Directions: A complex sentence is a sentence in which at least two ideas are combined into a single sentence.  What's so ""complex"" about that?  For example, look at the following sentence:
Because he forgot his wedding anniversary for the tenth straight year, Roger spent a week sleeping on the porch.
The two ideas expressed in the sentence are:

Roger forgot his wedding anniversary for the tenth straight year, and
Roger spent a week sleeping on the porch.

The two ideas could be expressed as two separate sentences, but they are more effectively expressed in a complex sentence.  In a complex sentence the two ideas can be combined in a way that shows their cause-and-effect relationship.  Notice how the word because explains to the reader the cause of Roger's problems.  What follows the cause is the effect:  Roger spent a week sleeping on the porch.
In the sentence about Roger, the word because is called a subordinating conjunction.  That might sound like a puzzling term, but it is simply a type of word that will help you show the relationships between your ideas.  Adverb clauses always begin with subordinating conjunctions.



Subordinating Conjunctions


Time
Cause and Effect
Contrast


after
because
although


before
since
while


as soon as
if
though


as
even though
whereas


when
 
unless


until
 
 


while
 
 




Here is another example of two simple sentences that might be combined into a single complex sentence with an adverb clause:
Simple Sentence
The jury didn't believe the woman.
The woman said that she killed her husband to prevent aliens from 
torturing him.
Combined Sentence
The jury didn't believe the woman when she said that she killed her husband to prevent aliens from torturing him.
As a writer, you have a choice to open a sentence with an adverb clause or end your sentence with an adverb clause.  Notice that when the adverb clause comes at the beginning, you use a comma to separate it from the rest of the sentence; but when the adverb clause comes at the end of the sentence, no comma is necessary.

"Title: Using Synonyms and Explanations as Context Clues
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension
Objective: Students learn about using context clues to help them
Directions: Synonyms (sin-o-nims) are different words that have nearly the same meaning, as in this sentence: ""It was a hot, sultry day.""
The way they are used here, ""hot"" and ""sultry"" mean much the same thing. And you can guess from the first what the second word means. As a rule of thumb, when two adjectives are used to describe the same thing, they often have similar or related meanings.
Another kind of context clue consists of explanations provided by the author. Authors want readers to understand what they write. When they use a word that readers may not be familiar with, they often explain it. This is especially true for words that belong to a special vocabulary. A special vocabulary means any group of words that is used mainly by one group of people. Doctors, for instance, have a special vocabulary. It includes words like arteriosclerosis, hypertension, thrombosis, and so on. The average person may not know these words. They don't have to, because they're not doctors. So when authors use one of these words, they often explain it for readers in context.
Watch how the term ""cardiopulmonary resuscitation"" is explained in the context of this next article:
Teen Saves Life at Reunion
ORANGE--Chris Walker knew just what to do when his aunt, Wilma Walker, collapsed of a heart attack at the Walker family reunion Sunday. The 16-year-old immediately began cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to circulate blood and provide oxygen until heart and lung function could be restored.
Notice how the term cardiopulmonary resuscitation is explained for readers. It's something you do ""to circulate blood and provide oxygen until heart and lung function can be restored.""
New words are often explained this way in textbooks too. The authors of textbooks don't expect you to know all the words they use. Nor do they expect you to stop and look them up. So they explain many of them as they go along.
Take the following passage from a biology book, for example. It introduces the word metabolism. This is a new word for most students. So the author defines it for readers in context. Watch for its meaning as you read the passage:
Malaria is a dramatic disease. In a typical attack, the victim first feels a severe chill. Gooseflesh forms, and his teeth chatter violently. Several hours later the sufferer feels very hot. He probably has a terrible headache and a feeling of nausea. Still later he begins to sweat. Clearly, the person's metabolism-that is, the way the parts of his body are working together-has been greatly upset by the disease.
Notice how the author defines the word metabolism for the reader. Metabolism means ""the way the parts of the body are working together."" As an example, the author describes how the disease upsets the normal process.
Distribute the activity sheets to students and have them use what they have learned about context clues to complete the activity.

"Title: Dear Diary
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Writing, Writing Process, Journaling
Objective: Students write narrative accounts in the form of diary entries from a character's point of view.  They engage the reader's interest and use sensory details and concrete language to develop plot and character.
Directions: Have students complete the following prewriting activities:

From a selected piece of literature, create a time line of scenes from beginning to end.
Complete a character sketch of the main character.
Analyze the main character's actions, speech, language, and personality.  Find specific examples in the text which reveal these traits.
Free-write on the topic ""What is usually written in a diary?""


Writing
Student will compose a series of diary entries from the point of view of their main characters.  To brainstorm diary entry topics, have students pretend to be their characters as they write in their journals.  Have them cluster, from the main character's point of view, the following words: 

hope
friend
vacation
loneliness


Then, have them free-write from the main character's point of view responses to the following: 

When I am alone, I like to . . . . 
My favorite relative is . . . .
The most embarrassing moment I ever had was when . . . . 


(Of course, if you think of different words to cluster or free-writing topics, use them!)  You do not have to keep your responses related to the plot of the story, but you do need to be consistent with the character.  
Publishing

Have students handwrite diary entries in the handwriting their characters might have.
Read one diary entry to the class.  See if they can guess who you are!


Technology Connections

Have students word-process the diary entries.  They can experiment with appropriate fonts.  
Have students create covers for their diaries, using creative borders, fonts, clip art, and colors.

"Title: Editorial Cartoons
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Art, Techniques
Objective: The students will use editorial cartoons to give messages or share with an audience particular points of view on an issue.
Directions: 

Select an editorial cartoon from a newspaper or magazine.  Tell the students that editorial cartoons usually focus on political or societal issues and are usually only one frame in length.  Instruct the students to read the cartoon carefully.
Discuss with the students the cartoonist's topic, audience, and purpose.  Ask students, ""What does the cartoonist want the reader to do or think after reading this cartoon?"" 
Divide students into pairs.  Have them generate a list of questions they have about the cartoon.  After 5-10 minutes, write some of the students' questions on the board.  Discuss the students' questions.  Make sure to clarify the humor, sarcasm, or irony in the cartoon.  Make sure that students understand the political or societal issue that is the topic of the cartoon.  Discuss the caption beneath the cartoon.
Ask the students, ""When is an editorial cartoon a good method for giving a message to the audience?"" and ""When is an essay a better method?""  Possible response:  An editorial cartoon is a good method for poking fun at a highly sensitive issue.
Find more examples of editorial cartoons and continue to discuss humor, sarcasm, and irony.  Make a chart with each of these words as a heading and record examples from cartoons in each of the categories.

Portfolio Piece:  Instruct students to select a topic.  Have them create an essay and a cartoon about the topic.  Finally, have them write a reflection about how different forms are appropriate for different purposes.
Publishing:  Create a bulletin board to display students' cartoons.
Technology Connection:  Have students scan their editorial cartoons and post them on the school's Web site.

"Title: Writing Police Reports: Emergency!
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students practice writing historical reports such as are done by emergency medical technicians and police officers.
Directions: Preparation

If possible, arrange for a visit by a police officer and/or emergency medical technician to speak to students about writing reports in their jobs.  An alternative is to arrange a field trip to a police station, fire station, (most now have paramedics on staff), or ambulance company.  Students think of these jobs as having glamour and do not realize that one of their most important responsibilities is writing reports.

Procedure 

Inform students they are going to learn a new kind of writing called historical writing--not because it's about an event like the Civil War or the Industrial Revolution, but because it is written to record what is happening right now but will be history once it is over.  Tell them historical writing seems easy.  They don't have to develop characters or write proper paragraphs with topic sentences as they do in writing fiction or essays.  They do have to write in detail and with accuracy, recording exactly what is happening, or has happened, in a situation.  It is the kind of writing done by doctors, nurses, firefighters, paramedics, and police officers.
Arrange for a visit from police officers or emergency medical technicians (optional but desirable), or a field trip to the paramedics of a fire station or a police station to visit with professionals for whom writing reports is a daily necessity.
To practice writing a chronological summary such as one a police officer must write, dictate the following fictional account of an incident which students are to record in a one-paragraph summary.

    Jennifer Cortez was waiting in line in a convenience store when an armed gunman ran into the store and pushed a gun in the face of the clerk.  ""Give me all the money in your cash register right now!"" he shouted.  Still watching the clerk, he turned to the four people standing in line and shouted, ""Turn your faces around to the back of the store and put your hands up!""  Jennifer was standing in line to pay for a soda and was startled.  The gunman wore a ski mask, a black sweatshirt, jeans, and dark glasses.  Jennifer began to cry because she was so scared.  ""Count to 10 before you turn around!""  the gunman said, collecting the money; then he backed out the door and ran around the side of the building.  The clerk called the police.

    Have students fill out the Crime Report (page 81) and write a one-paragraph summary of the incident with the information given.  In the paragraph, write only the necessary facts and write them in the exact order in which they happened.  Will you need to write that Jennifer cried?  No. Will you need to write that the gunman wore a mask? Yes. Discuss any problems or questions the students have.
    Display the Prehospital Care Report (page 82).  Explain that this is the kind of report a paramedic must fill out for every patient.  Note that information on this form consists of medical data with a detailed description of the patient's physical condition, including injuries and data regarding the patient's allergies and medical history.  ""Chief complaint"" would be the reason a paramedic was called.  Instead of a summary such as a police officer writes, a paramedic lists events and the times when they occur.  Time is given in military time--that is, in number of hours since 12:00 midnight.  In military time two P.M. would be 14:00 hours.  On this particular report we have the following:




 23:20   
 Arrived on scene--assessed pt. (patient)   


 23:25   
 Extricated from car with spine precautions   


 23:26   
 Vital signs taken (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration)   





Read the Emergency Incident (page 84) to students.  They are going to write crime reports and prehospital care reports for this incident.  Divide the class into cooperative learning groups.  Distribute to each group a blank crime report (page 81), a blank Prehospital Care Report (page 83), and a copy of the Emergency Incident (page 84).  Elicit from students that this incident is a crime because the driver of the car left the scene of the accident, which is hit and run--a crime.  Instruct each group to assign one person as recorder for the group, and to choose this person carefully because the report must be very neat.  When the activity is complete, discuss the student's results.  This activity may be repeated as often as needed until students are competent report writers.

Background/Follow-Up
It is said that over 90 percent of police recruits who do not make it onto the force fail because they are unable to write clear and accurate reports.  The same is true for paramedics, nurses, and doctors.  Clear, accurate reports are essential for success in any of these fields.

"Title: Hire Me!  I'm Nice!
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students practice creating resumes.
Directions: Since many students do not yet work, one way to practice resume writing is to have students pick a career they might be interested in pursuing in the future.  With the help of the class, list several possible career choices on the board or overhead.  Next, pass out sections of the classifieds to the students.  Explain how the classifieds are organized.  Show students how to find jobs that have been listed on the board.  Next, look for jobs that no one has mentioned.
After students have seen what types of jobs are available, you can assign careers in one of two ways:

Have students look through the classifieds and decide on a job.
Have students draw from a collection of classified advertisements that you have previously cut out and gathered.

When students decide on jobs, help them determine what type of education, work experience, etc., they will need for the job.  Encourage students to be creative and make up whatever information they will need for their resume.
Have students create their own resumes by studying the sample resume on page 51.  If students do not have access to a computer, you may want to allow the resumes to be handwritten.
For an optional activity, hand out only five or six different job descriptions to the entire class.  This way several students will apply for the same job.  Determine which students have the same jobs and set up a date for students to interview for the position.  The teacher can act as the employer, or another adult can be invited to the classroom to help with this activity.  Have the students interview for the jobs and compare their resumes to determine who gets ""hired"" for the position.
Use the following information to instruct students about writing a resume:
Unless you happen to know a friend or relative who is hiring, getting a job is not always easy.  It takes more to get a job than simply being a nice person.  Most companies will require you to show how qualified you are for the job you want.  Most will want to know your educational background and other job-related experiences that you've had.
Employers do not expect students to have extensive work experience, but they do want a resume that shows you have experience as a leader and that you would be a benefit to the company if they hired you.
Not every job requires a resume.  Many jobs only require that you fill out an application.  However, it is a good idea to have an updated resume on file at all times so that when a job becomes available that does require a resume, you are ready to go.  Remember these helpful hints when writing your own resume:

A resume lists a person's qualifications for a job.
It includes a person's name, address, and telephone number.
It includes a person's educational information and previous work experience.
Information on a resume should be listed in chronological order, listing the most recent experiences first.


On a resume, do not include your work experience if it is not relative to the job you are trying to get.  As a person gains more education, it is no longer necessary to include information such as middle school attended, etc.  However, if you are a student in high school and you are trying to get a job as a counselor at a summer camp, this type of information is relevant to your resume.
A resume should always be typed, and it should be no longer than one page.  There is no one correct style for a resume, but information should be neatly arranged on the page.  Remember that you are trying to persuade someone to hire you, so be sure and emphasize any qualifications you might have that will help you get the job.  A student looking for a job may want to include on his or her resume  items such as community service or future goals.
Some companies may ask for a written reference from your friends, family, or past employers.  A written reference is a letter from someone that recommends you as a good employee or worker.  Others may ask for a list of names and phone numbers of your references so that the employer can call and speak personally to the references you have given.

"Title: Impromptu Speech
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Oral Language, Listening, Speaking
Objective: Students will practice public speaking by giving short imprompt speeches.
Directions: The impromptu speech is an unprepared speech that one gives with spontaneity.  It is often done when the speaker draws a topic--sometimes a silly one--and gives the speech off the top of his or her head.  Each member of the class can supply one topic to put into the drawing.  If preferred, the class may base their speeches on the topics suggested on page 15.  
A speaker may prepare an impromptu speech by following the basic three-point speaker outline:  Introduction, Body, and Conclusion.

 Notes on the Introduction
The introduction may be an attention-getting statement, joke, or anecdote.  It is always a good idea for speakers to learn famous or well-known quotations, since these make great introductions.  It is also possible to present a simple incident in a dramatic or storytelling format.
Example:  A young child rummages through the garbage behind a grocery store.  She pulls her thin jacket around her frail body and shivers against the cold.  For her, this subject--hunger in America--is a harsh reality.
This introduction has accomplished several goals:

gotten the attention of the listener
personalized the subject
created sympathy for a presented need
provided an organizational tool to restate the need and develop a conclusion.

Notes on the Conclusion
When presenting a conclusion, refer back to the introduction.  
Example:  Feeding the hungry may hold little interest for the comfortable, but, to the child rummaging through garbage for provisions, it is of immediate interest today--and has an even graver impact on her tomorrows.

"Title: Introductions and Conclusions
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students learn about the importance of introductions and conclusions when writing an essay.
Directions: We all know the importance of teaching students to write clear, well-structured essays.  After all, the essay is the basic of most academic writing.  But we also know that teaching essay writing is not easy.  An introduction and conclusion are vital elements of a good essay.
The introduction of an essay serves two purposes: it clarifies what the essay is about, and it grabs the readers interest.  The first goal is straightforward.  The second is more challenging.
Ask students to think about some of their favorite movies.  Ask them to think about how the movies begin.  They will probably discover that most movies begin with a dramatic or suspenseful opening.  This is called a hook.  Whether it is a bit of slapstick humor or a violent encounter, the hook is intended to get you involved with the story right away and keep you watching.  The same principle applies to essay writing.
Tell students that this does not mean that they must begin their essays with a sensational opening.  However, they should interest the reader by showing, not telling.  Read the following two sentences to them:
""Kids eat a lot of food that is really bad for them.""
""The sugar-coated purple cereal is disappearing as you slurp it down with chocolate milk.""
The first sentence does a good job of clarifying the topic.  But which did students prefer?  The second version is more lively, beginning with a story line and grabbing the interest of the reader.  The words are lively and we are shown someone eating instead of being told about it.
The first sentence does not have to be quite so dramatic to catch the interest of the reader.  A sentence that gets the reader involved can also work.  For example-""What do you think of when you hear the words health food?""
The primary purpose of the conclusion is to bring the paper to an end, to wrap it up.  Like introductions, good conclusions are interesting, leaving the reader with a strong sense of the paper.  You should mention the points that you just covered, but you don't need to spell them out.  This can be done in a number of ways.  Read the following two conclusion sentences to students:
""In conclusion, eating healthful foods makes a lot of sense.""
""So, the next time you pop that jaw breaker into your mouth, the next time you eat oily potato chips for dinner, remember that there are tasty choices that won't hurt your body.""
The first sentence is OK.  It uses the helpful phrase in conclusion and reminds the reader what he or she just read.  But ask students again which sentence they preferred.  The second example is livelier and brings the essay to a close while keeping the reader involved.  It also has the same kinds of story line as the second introduction.  This is called an envelope strategy, which is common in essay and story writing.  You open and close your essay in the same way.  This helps to give your essay a sense of order.
Distribute copies of the Introductions and Conclusions activity sheet to students and have them try writing some interesting and lively introductions and conclusions.

"Title: Leads for Descriptive Writing
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Writing, Writing Process, Traits of Writing
Objective: The students will write a lead that develops the reader's interest and introduces the descriptive writing topic.
Directions: Procedure

Write a definition of a lead on the chalkboard or overhead: A lead is the way the author starts the text.   Leads must grab the reader and entice him/her to read on.
Read aloud the Example of a Description of Action (included with lesson plans).  Discuss with the students the following questions: Does this lead grab your attention?  Why or why not?  What words or phrases help develop your interest?  What is the topic of this descriptive piece of writing?
Display the activity page entitled, Kinds of Leads for Descriptive Writing. 
Have the students brainstorm a topic.  Instruct them to write two different leads for this topic and use the reproducible to guide their drafting.
Divide the students into pairs and have them read each of their leads aloud to their partners.  Have partners choose the lead that is the most engaging.  

Portfolio Piece
Have students write leads to be included in their portfolios.  Ask students to also write a reflection explaining how the kind of lead they chose will grab their reader's interest and make him/her want to read further. 
Publishing
Create an interactive bulletin board with student samples of each kind of lead posted on the board.  Make a folder of sentence strips identifying each kind of lead.  Students can match the kind of lead with the student example.
Technology Connection
Have students use a word-processing program to write their leads.  Encourage students to use spell check and grammar check.
Home-School Connection
Have students read a descriptive piece of writing in a magazine, highlight the lead, and discuss the method used to write the lead with a family member.
Assessment
Use the rubric for descriptive writing (included with activity pages)  to score the students' leads.

"Title: Newspaper Scavenger Hunts
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Reading Comprehension
Objective: Students use the newspaper to find specific information.
Directions: This is an enjoyable activity that can be incorporated into the classroom curriculum or used as Friday afternoon lessons.  Before you begin, have students bring in newspapers from home.  If students are unable to bring in newspapers, you can contact your local newspaper.  Many publishers have specific programs for schools where copies of newspapers can be purchased at a reduced rate.  Find an empty counter space and stack them in specific sections.  For example, in one pile put sports, in another pile put want ads, etc.
Scavenger Hunts are random ten-item lists.  No two students will have the same answers on their sheets upon completion of this activity. 
You might wish to divide the class into groups.  Have each group go to the newspaper counter and take a section from each pile.  Give the groups a copy of the Scavenger Hunt work sheet to put their answers on.  Each group will also need scissors and glue.  Students may use any section of the newspaper to find possible solutions.  Allow students to use maps or other reference materials as needed.
You will have to judge whether or not students find appropriate responses.  Have students justify their answers if there are doubts.  For example, if the list item says ""Something that you eat for lunch,"" and a group of students glues the word ""egg"" on their answer sheet, you might respond by telling them that an egg is a breakfast food.  If one student tells you that he or she had an egg salad for lunch, the group should be given credit for their response.  Interactions like these are not uncommon.  Allow students to use words or pictures from the newspaper, especially when the list item is followed by ""word"" or ""picture.""

"Title: Photography
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Art, Appreciation
Objective: The students will learn to use photography as an editorial enhancement.
Directions: This activity can be done in several parts.

Distribute page 124.  Discuss the ""photographs"" with the students and what might be happening in them.  Also discuss captions.  Define captions as brief descriptions or commentaries on photographs or illustrations.  After your discussion, have the students complete page 124.  Share their ideas.
Divide the students into groups.  Give each group an article and accompanying photograph.  Also distribute page 125.  Have each group answer the questions on page 125 in regards to the photograph and article.  Afterwards, discuss their findings.
Discuss the importance of showing only what is important to display in any photograph used with writing.  Tell the students that this is accomplished through cropping.  Cropping removes all superfluous, fuzzy, or potentially confusing elements.  Distribute page 126 to the students and ask them to crop the ""photographs"" there.  Afterwards, share their cropped photographs and discuss them.  Are most of the students' cropped photographs the same?
Now that the students have learned the basics of photographs that accompany writing, it is time for them to start from scratch.  Each student should write an editorial essay on a topic of his or her choice, taking the writing through the writing process.  When nearly complete, the student should either find a photograph or two from magazines and newspapers to include with the final draft or actually take accompanying photos with a camera.  (A third alternative is for the student to draw the photos.)  The final draft should be written with spaces for the photographs (as in a newspaper article).  If desired, this can be done on a computer, with the photographs scanned in place.
Share and display the editorials.

"Title: Preposition Practice
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Grammar
Objective: Students learn how to use prepositions.
Directions: Give students an introduction to prepositions.
Prepositions--Words that show a relationship between other words
To see how prepositions work, look at these two words:  
fox   log 
Prepositions can show the relationship between the fox and the log:
The fox was under the log.
The fox was on the log.
The fox was by the log.
The fox was in the log.
Prepositions always start prepositional phrases.  A phrase is a group of words that doesn't make a whole sentence--a group of words that do a job together.  These are all prepositional phrases:
under the log, on the log, by the log, in the log 
Prepositional phrases always begin with a preposition and end with the object of the preposition.  The object of the preposition is a word that answers What? or Whom? about the preposition.  Under what? The log.  On what?  The log.  In all the above prepositional phrases, log is the object of the preposition.
Here is a list of common prepositions:

"Title: Prepositions
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Grammar
Objective: Students will learn about prepositions and practice using them.
Directions: Introduction
Prepositions are words we use to show the relationship of a noun or a pronoun to another word in the sentence.  They can be called place words because they often tell us the positions of things. 
Examples:  
The puppy is on the chair.
The girl is beside the chair.
The bone is under the chair.
The prepositions on, beside, and under all refer to the noun chair.  They tell us the relationship between it and the puppy, the girl, and the bone.

Problem prepositions
among/between-Something is shared among several people or things (three or more).  Something is shared between two people or things.
Examples:  
I divided the cake among the whole class.
I divided the cake between Mary and me.
in/into-In shows position in one place.  Into shows movement from one place to another.
Examples:  
The teacher is in the room.
The boy dived into the river.
different from-One thing or person is different from another.  Never say different than.
beside/besides-Beside means at the side of.  Besides means in addition to.
Examples:  
The teacher stood beside the table.
Several girls were there besides Margaret.

Preposition or adverb? 
Some prepositions may look like adverbs.  To tell whether the word is a preposition or an adverb, look at the way it is used.  Look at the following sentences.
I fell down.  Down is an adverb of place.  It tells where I fell.
I walked down the road.  Down is a preposition governing road.
Remember also that a preposition has a noun or pronoun after it.
Teaching Strategies 
Question time 
Ask children to describe the positions of some objects in the classroom.  Tell children they must reply using a preposition in a sentence.
Where is the clock?
The clock is under the picture.
Where is the television?
The television is beside the table.
Preposition opposites 
Have children provide the opposites of given prepositions.
The snake crawled over the rock.
The snake crawled under the rock.
Jumbled prepositions
Give children exercises in which the prepositions are jumbled.  Have children identify the preposition or write it correctly.
The bird flew (voer) the tree.
The bird flew over the tree.

"Title: Problem and Solution:  Piece of Pie
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process, Mathematics, Data Analysis and Probability
Objective: The students will use pie charts to support their writing.
Directions: 

Instruct each student to write a list of everything he or she does during a normal day and approximately how much time he or she spends doing each thing.  You might wish to have each student keep track of his or her time over the course of a day or two.
Distribute the Piece of Pie Chart work sheet.  Discuss the chart with the students.  Explain how each segment represents a percentage.  (Review percentages and fractions, if necessary.)
Draw the chart from the work sheet on the board, but change the percentage information.  Have the students come to the board to reconfigure the chart, reflecting the new statistics.
Distribute one copy of the Pie Chart Teplate to each student.  Have the student use the gray guidelines to complete the chart for the way he or she spends the day.  The gray lines mark every hour.  The student should trace over the appropriate lines with a crayon.  The represented segment (label) can then be written darkly in the space with pencil or pen, and then the space filled in lightly with crayon so as not to cover the label.  Each segment should use a different color crayon so they are easily distinguishable from one another.
Looking at the completed pie chart, each student should consider the use of time it reflects and find a problem area (e.g., too much television time or too little sleep).  Now, distribute a second copy of the Pie Chart Template.  Determining the problem, the student should complete a new pie chart that reflects a solution--a better use of time.
With pie charts in hand, the student will write a problem-and-solution essay:  the problem is the original use of time, and the solution is the new arrangement.  The neat and colored pie charts can be bound with the completed writing and displayed for others to see.

Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students learn about writing and sending e-mail.
Directions: Faster Than the Pony Express:
Discuss e-mail with students.
If they own computers, chances are they have either sent or received e-mail.
Ask them, what's so special about e-mail? It's fast and convenient. E-mail messages are received instantly; and depending on the computer used, you can also send and receive pictures and voice messages with your mail. Traditional snail mail simply can't compare to the speed of the computer.
Discuss with students that writing a letter that is to be sent by e-mail is a little different than writing a letter that is to be sent through the postal service. One of the main differences is that all e-mailed letters are typed. Another obvious difference is there is no stamp or envelope needed.
There are a few rules you need to follow when sending and receiving e-mail.

Do not write in all capital letters. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE YELLING WHEN YOU DO THIS!
Do include a salutation. It makes the letter more personal.
Do use correct capitalization and punctuation.
Do check your spelling.
Do not say anything you might regret. Once you hit the send button, your e-mail has been electronically mailed.
Do reply promptly to e-mail that requires a response from you.


E-mail does not require a written signature. Since the letter is not printed on paper, a signature is not required. You can, of course, type your name at the end of the letter if you wish. Also, you do not need to include the date. Mail that is sent via the computer automatically includes the date.
If you are planning to send an e-mail, the screen will show a display that looks similar to this:



 Send To: 
 


 Subject: 
 




The e-mail address of the person who is receiving the letter should be placed in the ""send to"" box. You do not have to fill in the ""subject"" box, but it is a good idea to put some type of note to let the reader know what the letter will be about. For example, if you are writing to tell the person about your dog's trip to the veterinarian, you might write ""Duncan's checkup.""

"Title: Storytelling:  Chill Out
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Oral Language, Listening, Speaking
Objective: Students practice the art of storytelling.
Directions: Storytelling

The art of storytelling has been around almost as long as humans have.  Stories have been passed down as family treasures to be taken out, enjoyed, wrapped in memories, and carefully tucked away to be cherished by yet another generation.  The stories of how our families came to settle where they did; how they survived hard times; how our parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles met and married have become the keynote speeches of the family dinners.
The ability to relate a story well is a skill that will enrich everyone's lives and create emotional ties between new generations of our families and friends.  These are the stories most requested by separated or adopted children.  The stories provide us with a sense of belonging and a secure place in the world.

Stories are priceless gifts that should not be lost with the passing of our family members but should be filed away to be discovered and treasured by future generations.  The struggles our families faced to settle a new world and our victories over those struggles provide our strength to overcome future struggles that we--or our children--might face.

We are all survivors of the perils of the ages and have in our families stories of the Civil War, westward expansion, persecution, and the fabric that makes up the history of mankind.  Develop and preserve these stories and the ability to relate them.

The activity that follows provides the format and opportunity to develop these storytelling skills.  The stories may be organized by use of an organizer called the storyboard.  The stories need not be written out but rather organized in topical format, or outline, and related to the group.

Storytelling:  Chill Out

No storytelling unit would be complete without the tale of terror.  The ""gotcha'"" stories are in this category also.  A gotcha' story is one that sounds frightening and is filled with suspense.  At the end the storyteller yells out and grabs someone close saying ""Gotcha'!""  These stories are often related in the dark, at camp outs, and at slumber parties.  No doubt you have already heard many.
This is a story type that allows the storyteller to set the mood.  The speaker may build suspense by using facial expressions or vocal inflections.  A good storyteller can scare the daylights out of his or her listeners!  The success of recent horror movies shows us that many of us love to be scared.  Perhaps it is a way of confronting our fears and making us see how silly they really are.  There are classic tales of terror that have been told for generations.

Assignment:  Prepare and tell a tale of terror you have heard, or create an original.  Use the storyboard organizer on page 100 to prepare your story and share it with the class.  The following is a list of classic tales of terror that circulate today.  These might help you select your own tale of terror.

The Man with the Hook Arm
The Hitchhiker
A babysitter gets a call from a murderer who claims he is calling from inside the house.
A girl is followed home by a man who keeps turning on his bright lights, only to discover he is trying to protect her from the person hiding in her back seat.
The girl at the slumber party  who goes to the grave to  plunge in a letter opener  to prove to others she is  not afraid.  She  unknowingly plunges it  into the hem of her  nightgown.  It pins her to  the grave; and thinking  she is being grabbed  by the living dead, she  dies of fright. 

These are common stories, but you may have better tales of terror to tell!

"Title: The Star of My Show
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students create star mobiles to highlight writing of their own lives, focusing on their achievements since birth.
Directions: 

Ask each student to brainstorm significant events from his or her life onto a sheet of paper.  The student should then organize those ideas in sequence.  (The student should list at least five items but no more than fifteen.)
Have each student write an autobiographical narrative of his or her life, telling the story through the narration of these significant events.  (The student need not go into significant detail about any  single event; leave such detail for a future writing assignment.)  Have the student edit and revise as you desire.
Distribute page 25.  Ask each student to cut out the star patterns.  The student should count the number of events listed in his or her narrative and reproduce that number of stars onto a desired color of construction paper.  The stars should graduate in size:  the most distant events will be written on the smallest stars and the most recent on the largest.  The largest star of all should be reserved for the top of the mobile.
Using fine-point markers, have the student write the events on the stars, one event per star (graduating the stars as stated in step 3).
Punch a hole in the top of each star.
Have each student trace the pattern of the largest star onto cardstock.  Glue the cardstock to construction paper with the pattern facing up.  Cut out the cardstock star.  Punch a hole near the tip of each of the star's five points.
Cut a length of fishing line or thread and staple it to the center of the cardstock star.  (Staple the thread to the cardstock side.  The construction paper side should face down.)  Then tie lengths of line to each hole at the star's points, graduating the lengths so they are progressively longer.
Tie the ""life event"" stars to the threads in order, tying the smallest star to the shortest string.  If there are more than five events, punch holes in the bottom of the hanging stars and add graduated lengths of thread to them, adding the additional stars until they are all hanging.
Tack or staple the mobiles to the ceiling.  Display the autobiographical narratives on a nearby bulletin board, bordered with stars.

"Title: Twin Words
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Vocabulary
Objective: Students learn about twin words.
Directions: Introduction 
Grammar is concerned with the way an overall text is structured to engage an audience and to deliver its message and with the way we choose particular words appropriate to that audience and message.  It is important to generate an interest in words and to encourage children to be thoughtful about the words they use.  If students develop an interest in language at an early age, they should continue to appreciate throughout their school life and into adulthood the richness and diversity of our ever-growing language.
Review twin words with students.  These are words that are often paired together, especially in speech.  Example:  salt and pepper
Have students complete the Twin Words activity sheet.
Try some of these teaching strategies for additional grammar practice.
Homophone hunt 
Write a list of words on the chalkboard.  Challenge students to think of the corresponding homophones.  They can also create cartoons to illustrate the homophones.



allowed/aloud
ate/eight
eye/I
bare/bear


bean/been
blew/blue
board/bored
brake/break


flea/flee
hear/here
knit/nit
one/won


pair/pear
sun/son
 




Fish 
On blank playing cards write pairs of synonyms, antonyms, or homophones. Encourage children to play ""Go Fish"" with them.
Scattered letters
Write a selection of letters scattered on the chalkboard.  Have children think of as many words as they can using the letters.  Make the game more challenging by introducing a timer.
Word collection
Organize a word collection bulletin board in the classroom.  Encourage children to find, collect, and then display words on the board.  The board could have a number of different headings, such as Interesting Words,  Words That Sound Funny,  Words That Sound Like Noises,  Words That Sound Important.  Ask children to think of other headings they would like to use.
Tongue twisters 
Challenge children to say a tongue twister quickly.  Then have them make up their own tongue twisters for their friends to try.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
Odd words 
Have children search for words with interesting or unusual features.  Here are some to start them off.
hijinks: three dotted letters in a row
strength: eight letters but only one vowel
subbookkeeper: four sets of double letters
facetious: all the vowels in their correct order
cauliflower: contains all the vowels
education: contains all the vowels
Daily letter race 
Challenge children to write in two minutes all the words they can that begin with the first letter of that day of the week.
Word link
Have one child say a word.  The next child has to respond by saying a word that starts with the letter that the first word ended with.  Make the game more or less challenging by setting a rule determining the minimum number of letters or syllables that the words must have, or require a specific part of speech.



Rule:
two or more syllables


First child:
humor


Second child:
rubble


Third child:
elephant




Continuous story
Divide the class into groups.  Have one child in each group start a story by saying one word.  The next child in the group then adds another word and so on until the group has, word by word, written a story that makes sense.  The group that can go on the longest is the winner.

"Title: Using Imagery
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students will learn to use imagery to create pictures in a reader's mind.
Directions: Preparation
Reproduce one Just Imagine work sheet for each student in the class.  Gather together the crayons or colored pencils for student use.
Lesson Plan

Write the following on the chalkboard:  Show, don't tell.
Tell students that they are going to play a new game, not Show and Tell as they know it, but ""Show, Don't Tell.""
Write the following sentences on the chalkboard:
    
The baseball player argued with the umpire.
The ace pitcher hurled his glove at the mound, then spit words at the man behind the plate.


Ask students to identify which sentence tells what happened and which sentence shows what happened.  (The second sentence is the better sentence--it shows what happened.)
Explain that writers use precise words to paint pictures in the reader's mind.  This is how authors show the reader what is happening.  It is much more exciting and interesting for the reader to be able to ""see"" in their mind what the author is writing about.
Challenge pairs of students to turn the following sentences into showing sentences:
    
The basement floor was flooded.
The toddler was angry.
The cars crashed.
I ate the chocolate doughnut.
The painting was an antique.


Allow students to share their showing sentences.  Ask the class to point out specific words that helped paint a picture in their minds.
Distribute the Just Imagine work sheet.  Review the directions with students.  Read the poem ""Mabel"" aloud as students underline precise words.  Allow time for students to complete the rest of the work sheet and share their original ""Mabel"" poems.

Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Reading, Vocabulary, Oral Language, Listening
Objective: Students will learn about onomatopoeia or words that sound like the objects or actions which they are describing.
Directions: 1. Define onomatopoeia for students.
2. Distribute the What's That Sound? work sheet.  Review the directions on the work sheet and complete the first part of the work sheet with the students.  Help students notice that the sounds that animals make are examples of onomatopoeia.
3. Continue pointing out examples of onomatopoeia by completing the second section of the work sheet, writing sounds that specific objects make.
4. To complete the work sheet, assist students in generating sounds that would be heard if they were involved in the actions listed in the third section of the work sheet.
5.Hand out the Onomatopeic Words work sheets to students to use as a reference for poetry writing.

"Title: Using Transitions
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Students learn the importance of using transitional phrases in their writing.
Directions: Give students the following information about using transitions in writing.
Paragraphs are the building blocks of an essay.  This is particularly true in a format as straightforward as the five-paragraph essay.  Each paragraph counts as its own unit and serves a unique purpose. 
When writing paragraphs, it is important for the series of ideas flow together.  They do so with the help of transitions.  Without effective transitions, your paragraphs will come across as disconnected, as a series of facts without any relationship.  Transitions link ideas so that they relate to one another; they provide comparison and contrast, and they strengthen and weaken ideas.
Keep in mind that you need transitions between paragraphs, too.  In some cases, transitions are single words.  Other times they consist of more than one word, in which case they are called transitional phrases.
Write on the board or give as a handout the list of transitions below.
above
according to
after
also
although
another
because
beside(s)
clearly
consequently
finally
first, second . . .
for example
for instance
furthermore
however
in addition to
in fact
last
meanwhile
moreover
nevertheless
next
obviously
of course
similarly
since
therefore
while
yet
Transitions serve all sorts of purposes.  Once students get accustomed to using them, they will become second nature, and students will achieve a more fluid writing style.
Give students the following final information and examples of transitions:
When transitions begin a sentence, they often require the use of a comma.
""There is a lot left to be done.  For example, we have to clean the house.""
Transitions and transitional phrases don't always have to appear at the beginning of a sentence.  
""It is, however, important to vote when you turn eighteen.""
Distribute copies of the Using Transitions activity sheet to students.  Have them use the list of transitions to help them complete the activity.

"Title: Which Is Which?:  Italics or Quotation Marks?
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Punctuation
Objective: Students learn about appropriate punctuation.
Directions: Discuss with students the importance of correctly referencing titles or names in their writing.  Introduce to them some of the rules of italics and quotation marks.
Sometimes it is difficult to choose between italics (or underlining) or quotation marks when you are referring to a title or name in your writing.  Use the chart below to help distinguish which type of punctuation is appropriate.
Italics or Underlining
Note:  When reading printed material or using a computer to compose your writing, the title should appear in italics.  Since it is not practical to handwrite in italics, underlining can be substituted when italics are not an available option.

"Title: Whose Is It? (Pronouns and Antecendents)
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Grammar
Objective: Students will learn about pronoun and antecedent agreement.
Directions: Present the following to students:
Agreement of Pronoun and Antecedent
What is an antecedent?  An antecedent is the word to which a pronoun refers.
Betty brought her book to class.
In this sentence, her is the only pronoun.  Its antecedent is Betty because Betty is the word to which the pronoun refers.  When we talk about pronoun-antecedent agreement, we mean that pronouns must agree in number and gender with their antecedents.  If Betty is the antecedent, we couldn't say, ""Betty brought his book,"" or ""Betty brought their book.""  In those sentences, the pronouns don't agree with their antecedents.
The only time this gets tricky is when we use the indefinite pronouns.  These are indefinite pronouns:
one, everyone, someone, no one, anyone, everybody, nobody, anybody, somebody, each, either, neither, several, few, both, many, all, most, any, none.
Here are the rules about using indefinite pronouns properly so that the pronoun and antecedent agree:

These indefinite pronouns are singular and therefore take a singular antecedent: one, everyone, someone, no one, anyone, everybody, nobody, anybody, somebody, each, either, neither.

It's easy to remember most of these because most of them end in either one or body, and we know that one and body are singular.
Everybody has his or her book.
Note: In the above sentence, many people would use the word their in place of his or her.  This is incorrect because everybody is a singular pronoun which is not gender specific.  Many people prefer to use the male pronoun his when referring to all of us.  This is still considered acceptable grammar.  Nowadays, however, we generally say his or her so that we have a singular pronoun and are not being gender-biased.

These indefinite pronouns are plural and therefore take plural antecedents: several, few, both, many.

(Write the following sentences on the board and have students identify the antecedents)
Several students lost their books.
Many of us have taken our tests.

These indefinite pronouns may be either singular or plural, depending on how they are used in a sentence: all, most, any, none.

(Write the following on the board and have students identify whether the pronouns should be singular or plural.)
Most of the apples are rotten. (plural)
Most of the milk is gone. (singular)
Note: If a sentence has a compound antecedent (more than one) joined by or or nor, the pronoun agrees with the antecedent closer to it.
Either the girls or Jose brought his car.
Either Jose or the girls brought their car.
Distribute the activity sheets and have students practice the rules that they have learned.

"Title: Writing and Following Instructions
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process
Objective: Getting students to understand the importance of following instructions is not always an easy task, but it is definitely worth the effort.  What's the best way to teach such an important skill?  To teach this lesson it may simply be better to show than to tell.
Directions: Pass out copies of the worksheet on page 74; read the material on this page to the class.  Pass out copies of the worksheet on page 75.  Follow the directions given for Section A of Part 2 on page 75.  When everyone has finished writing instructions for how to put on a jacket, ask for a volunteer to read his or her paper out loud.  As the student reads his instructions, try to put on the jacket.  The task will be nearly impossible because most students do not even begin with the most basic instruction:  pick up the jacket.  It is hard to put on something that is not in your hands.  After two or three students have read their instructions, discuss what changes are needed for the instructions to be correct.

Now tell the students to work on Section B of the worksheet and to write instructions, for sharpening a pencil.  When everyone has finished, ask for a volunteer to go to the pencil sharpener.  Next, have someone read his or her instructions.  Instructions this time should be more accurate as students should begin to understand the importance of detail when writing directions.  Be sure and point out that following and listening to instructions is as important as giving good instructions.  Even a good explanation will not work if the other person doesn't pay attention to the details.

"Title: Woman Reporter
Grade Level: 5th - 8th Grades
Description: Social Studies, United States History
Objective: Students learn about one of the first female reporters.   They use her technique of firsthand knowledge about a subject to write newspaper articles.
Directions: This activity can be completed as part of a Women's History Month unit, or as a standalone activity.
Begin the activity by introducing students to Nelly Bly, who was a woman reporter long before it was common to find women in the field.
What twenty-year-old woman in 1887 would dare have herself committed to a mental institution in order to write an article about the treatment of the mentally ill?  Having achieved success with this technique once, what woman would dare to try it again to find out about prison life, sweat shops, and slums?  The only correct answer to both questions is Elizabeth Cochran Seaman, better known as Nelly Bly!
Elizabeth received her first job when she wrote a response to an article that appeared in the Pittsburgh Dispatch.  The article had been titled ""What Girls Are Good For.""  Elizabeth's letter convinced many people, including the editor of the Dispatch, that women were good for writing.
America became aware of the woman reporter through the work of ""Nelly Bly,"" Elizabeth's pen name taken from a song by Stephen Foster.  For her stories, she went down in a diving bell and up in a balloon; she posed as a Salvation Army worker, a ballet dancer, and a criminal; she even spent the night in a house that was supposed to be haunted.
But her greatest feat was a trip around the world in only 72 days, 6 hours, and 11 minutes; she had broken the record of a character in Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days.  By using trains, boats, and horses, she had made the trip of a lifetime and had even found time to stop in France and interview Verne himself.  The headline on the day of the twenty-three-old woman's return to New York was ""Father Time Outdone.""  Elizabeth often laughed and told about her uncle who had also traveled around the world--in a period of three years.
When Elizabeth was thirty, she married millionaire Robert Seaman who was eighty years old.  Elizabeth retired from her work as a reporter.  When Seaman died in 1904, she attempted to run his business, but lawsuits with employees cost her the fortune.  Elizabeth returned to newspaper writing.
At a time in history when many women were restricted to housework and family, Elizabeth was a pace-setter with her travels, her adventures, and her writing.  Until her death by pneumonia in 1922 at age 55, she was employed at the New York Journal and doing what she liked best--writing!
Suggested Activities

Discussion Questions
    
Knowledge: What was Nelly Bly's married name?
Comprehension: Why was a trip around the world so unusual in Nelly's time?
Creative Thinking: Plan a news story that Nelly might wish to cover in your community.  Remember that she covered haunted houses, hospital visits, and tried various occupations.
Application: Write a news story about something that is going on in your school.  Be sure to give it a ""catchy"" title.
Analysis: List some of the news stories that Nelly Bly wrote.
Synthesis: Plan a trip around the world for Nelly today.  Try to use as many means of transportation as possible.  Do not forget you can include camels and donkeys as well as rockets and planes.  (Be sure to use the animals in their appropriate settings.)  To help you, use a chart with these headings: From (Place), To (Place), Method of Transportation.
Evaluation: Which of the modes of transportation you listed above is the most unusual?  Which do you think Nelly would enjoy most?  Why?
Affective: Nelly made a difference by writing about the treatment of the mentally ill people.  Is there a group of people in society today that is not getting a ""fair shake"" in your opinion?  Is there anything you can do to make a difference in their lives?


Skills Focus
    
Language and Communication Skills: Pretend you are Nelly Bly and that you have just completed the trip around the world as planned in the activity above.  Have a friend interview you and ask you questions about that trip.
Independent Study Skills: Is there an award given to good news stories?  Use your library to find out about this award(s).
Manipulative Skills: Using a large sheet of construction paper, display the news stories each class member has written.  Post the ""newspaper"" somewhere in your school for others to see.


Social Science
    
Job Description:  When you accompany your parents to the grocery store or when you visit the school cafeteria, observe the workers.  Watch what they do.  Watch what others say to them.  When you get a chance, write a description of one of the jobs.  What are the good points of that job?  Are there bad points?  Describe this occupation as Nelly Bly might have written about it.




Distribute the Newspaper Article activity sheet to students.  Have them use what they have learned about Nelly Bly to complete the activity.
