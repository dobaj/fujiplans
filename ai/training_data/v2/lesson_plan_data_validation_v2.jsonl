Most of the time in the ancient world is recorded as b.c. (before Christ).  Some books use b.c.e. (before the common era).  This time record counts backwards from the approximate date of Christ's birth until the earliest dates in recorded history.  The bigger the number named with b.c. or b.c.e., the further back in time the event occurred.

Anno Domini is a Latin expression meaning \"in the year of Our Lord.\"  The year 2000 a.d. is about 2,000 years since the birth of Christ.  The abbreviation c.e. (common era) means exactly the same time as a.d.  The year 2000 can be written as 2000 a.d. or 2000 c.e.  Some books use c.e. and others use a.d.  Numerical dates in a.d.

An angle that is more than 180 degrees and less than 270 degrees is called an oblique angle.  This angle is not often used.\r\nTriangles are named by the types of angles and sides they contain:\r\nAn equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length and three angles of equal measure.  \r\nAn isocoles triangle has at least two sides with the same measure.  \r\nA scalene triangle has no equal sides. \r\nA right triangle has one right angle (90 degrees).\r\nAn acute triangle has all angles less than 90 degrees.\r\nAn obtuse triangle has one angle greater than 90 degrees.\r\nHave students use the first Triangle Puzzler activity sheet to identify different types of triangles.

The equation is written so that the values on the left side of the equal sign equal the values on the right side of the equal sign.  Solve the equation so that the unknown value represented by a letter is alone on one side of the equal sign and the value of the unknown is on the other side of the equal sign.\nSample:  Jennifer has $25.00. She needs $49.00 to buy a new school outfit. How much more money does she need?

Any value added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided to one side of the equal sign must be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided respectively to the other side.\nSample:  A group of 5 girls decided to split evenly the $18.75 cost of a CD album by their favorite group.  How much money did each girl spend?  Write an equation.  Solve for n (the amount each girl spent) by dividing each side of the equation by 5.

Write an equation where n equals Sammy's age.  Let 3n + 2 = Sammy's mother's age.  Since the total of their ages equals 42, then n + 3n + 2 = 42;  Then combine the terms:  4n + 2 = 42;  Use the axioms of equality by subtracting 2 and then dividing by 4. Sammy is 10 years old.

In algebra, if a number is unknown, any letter of the alphabet can be used to stand for that number.  Letters are called variables because the values of the letters vary from one problem to another.  In one problem, x may stand for -2.  In another problem, it may stand for 43.\r\nWriting Algebraic Expressions\r\nAn algebraic expression is a statement made up of numbers, variables, and signs of operation \r\n(+, -, \u00f7, x).  The phrase \"a number\" indicates the use of the variable.\n\r\nCombining Like Terms\r\nSometimes algebraic expressions can be shortened by combining like terms making them simpler to understand.  An expression is made up of smaller parts called terms.  A term can be made up of numbers, variables, or numbers and variables.  In an expression, terms are separated by only plus and minus signs.\r\nExamples: 15, x, xy, 5xy, 4x/y\r\nA numerical coefficient is any number in front of a variable in a term. If there is no number in front of a varible, the numerical coefficient is understood to be 1.\n\r\nAn exponent tells how many times a number has been multiplied by itself.  Examples: 42, 8w3, 10n3\r\nTerms that have all of the same variables (xy, 3xy, 5xy, etc.) or variables with the same exponents (4a2 + a2), are called like or similar terms.  Like terms can be combined by combining the numerical coefficients.\n\r\nBut an algebraic expression like  9y2 + 2y cannot be combined because y2 and 2y are not like terms.  One has an exponent of 2 and the other has a coefficient of 2.\r\nEvaluating Algebraic Expressions\r\nRemember that in algebra a variable can stand for any number.  However, sometimes in an algebraic expression, you are given the value of the letter.  Then you must replace the variables with the numbers they represent to solve for the value of the whole expression.\n\r\nDistribute the activity sheets and have students complete the activity.\nResources: , Working with Algebraic Expressions activity sheets, \n, pencils,"}]}

A food chain shows how living things need each other for food.  A green plant is usually found at the bottom of a food chain.  The plant uses energy from the sun to carry on a process called photosynthesis.  This allows the plant to produce its own food.  As a result, the plant in a food chain is called a producer.\r\nThe producer, or plant, is eaten by an animal that is a herbivore, which is an animal that eats only plants, or an omnivore, which is an animal that eats plants and other animals.  On the food chain, the animal that eats the producer is called a consumer.  This is because it consumes the producer.\r\nIn the next part of a food chain, the consumer is eaten by another animal that is a carnivore, which is an animal that eats only meat, or an omnivore.  This animal is also called a consumer.\r\nHere is an example of a food chain.  Notice that the arrows start with the producer and point toward the consumers.\r\nProducer --> Consumer --> Consumer\r\n(Grass) --> (Grasshopper) --> (Bird)\r\nThere are many food chains living in a community.  Some are very simple, while others are more complex.  Since most animals eat more than one type of food, they might have several different food chains that can be made.  When food chains connect or overlap, it is called a food web.  If one part of the food web becomes extinct, the entire web may be affected, causing drastic consequences.\r\nWrite these examples of food webs on the board:\r\nSnowy Owl --> Lemming --> Plants\r\nSnowy Owl --> Arctic Hare --> Plants\r\nSnowy Owl --> Ground Squirrel --> Plants\r\nAsk students if they can create a food web that begins with humans.

Pass the sponge around so students can see how light it is.  Cut it in half to show that the holes are throughout the sponge.  Let students know that these are really air sacs in the sponge, not holes, and that their lungs have these as well.

The crust is actually very thin compared to the rest of the Earth.  If the shell were removed from the hard-boiled egg and the egg sprayed with paint, the thin layer of the paint would closely resemble the depth of the crust relative to the internal sections of the planet.\r\nWhen equipment made it possible to map the ocean floor and dive to the great depths, another world opened to scientists.  High ridges and deep trenches were discovered on the ocean floor.  Molten lava was seen pouring from cracks in the ocean floor.  This added to the knowledge of the Earth's crust and helped support the theory of Continental Drift.  The crust is constantly being recycled as new, molten material rises through cracks and pushes aside old material before solidifying.\r\nEdges of some of the crustal plates are diving beneath others, creating earthquakes and volcanic activity.  An example of this is the Pacific Plate.  The collision of these plates also causes uplifting of mountain ranges.  This can be seen along the western edge of South America as the Nazca Plate pushes under the South America Plate, lifting up the Andes Mountain range along the coastline.\r\nAs a plate dives beneath another, it begins to melt down when it comes in contact with the hotter mantle lying under the crust.

They saw that planets moved across the sky from east to west each day.  However, they also slipped eastward throughout the year.  Since astronomers believed the planets were traveling around Earth, they assumed the paths would always move eastward, like the sun.  What they observed was very different.  The planets did move eastward, but from time to time they would slow down, stop, and then begin moving westward.  Gradually, they would slow down again until they stopped and resumed their eastward motion again.  Thus, they appeared to be making loops in their paths.  The loops varied in size with each planet, and not every planet was looping at the same time.  This was finally explained by the theory that the planets were traveling around Earth within their own circular orbits, called epicycles.  Later, it was proved that the planets revolve around the sun, not Earth.  Now, a different explanation for this backwards, or retrograde, motion was needed.  \r\nMars will be used as the example in this activity to show students what the retrograde loop looks like when plotted against the constellations and why we see this happening.\n\nMake transparencies of Mars Motion in 1971 and Explaining Retrograde Motion.

What is the direction of Mars from #1 position to #4? (eastward)\nDescribe what happened after that.  (The planet began to move westward after #5 until #9 when it began to move eastward again.)\nWas there any change in Mars' appearance at this time? (Yes, it increased in size from #1 to its largest size on August 11 at position #7.  It then began to become smaller)\nWhat happened to its brightness? (Mars became brighter as it grew in size and then dimmer as it reduced in size.)\nWhy would Mars change in size and brightness?

Most of these were designed over 2,000 years ago, spread symmetrically around a point above Earth's North Pole. Today Polaris (the North Star) is over the Pole, but that was not so then. As Earth rotates on its axis, it wobbles like a top so that the north axis pole moves in a circular motion over a 26,000-year period. This changes the locations of constellations.\r\nThe 12 zodiac constellations are located along the ecliptic, the path the sun appears to follow as Earth revolves around it. The moon and planets also follow this path and are seen against the band of zodiac constellations. Astronomy had its beginnings in astrology, a belief that human behavior was controlled by the motion of the planets, sun, and moon within zodiac constellations. We know now that there is no connection between how these celestial bodies move and what happens to anyone on Earth. But astrologers carefully recorded the changing locations of these bodies, and this valuable data later helped astronomers understand more about the motions of planets.\r\nThe sun's position within zodiac constellations is different today. Along with the wobble of Earth, the planet does not return to exactly the same location in its orbit at the same time each year. Thus, the sun gradually moves into the next zodiac constellation. The months when the sun is in each zodiac constellation (pages 61 and 62) do not match the dates in horoscopes, but are astronomically correct for the present time.\r\nThe zodiac and other constellations serve as useful maps of the sky, helping us locate planets, comets, and other celestial bodies. Monthly constellation charts can help students locate patterns in the sky and find the planets moving among these star patterns.\r\nActivity: simulating the sun's path through the zodiac constellations\r\nMaterials: zodiac constellations (pages 61 and 62), overhead projector, 12 sheets of large black construction paper, chalk or white marker, clamp-on light with 150-watt bulb\nLesson Preparation\n\nMake transparencies of the zodiac constellations. Project them onto the large black paper individually; use the white marker to trace the stars (dots) and lines. The sizes of the dots denote brightness, not size. The larger dots are brighter stars.\nInclude the constellation name, when the sun is there, and when it is seen.\nUse a large room for this lesson. Using a string four feet (122 cm) long with a loop at one end and a piece of chalk tied to the other, make a circle in the center of the floor. Have someone hold the loop of the string in the center of the floor, stretch out the string, and use the chalk to draw the circle. Shorten the string to 2.5 feet (76 cm) and draw another circle within the first, using the same center point. Place the lamp in the center of these circles at the students' eye level.\n\n\nProcedure\n\nShare the background information about the zodiac constellations, using the transparencies to enable students to see what they look like.\nTake the students to a large room. Have 12 students hold the zodiac pictures. Have them spread out equally around the large circle. The constellations should be in order of the numbers, moving in a clockwise direction around the circle.\nHave the remaining students stand around the inner circle, facing the constellations. Turn on the bright light and turn off the room lights. Tell students that the bright light is the sun and they are the Earth. Have them spin slowly in their positions in a counterclockwise direction (west to east) to simulate day and night. Day is when they face the sun (light), night when they face away from the light and see the stars.\nExplain that if they could go north out beyond the solar system, they would see the Earth move around the sun in a counterclockwise direction. Let them begin to walk slowly in a counterclockwise direction around the circle, looking at the constellations as they do so. Point out that these change as they move. Explain that from Earth we see new constellations gradually appearing in the eastern sky, as those in the west gradually disappear below the western horizon. It takes 12 months to get back to the original set of constellations. Have them walk all the way around the circle, mentally marking the constellation they see at the beginning, and stopping there after walking around the circle. Explain that they have just gone through one year.\nHave students collect on one side of the light, face towards it, and try to see the constellations opposite it. Explain that the sun is so bright we can't see the stars beyond it. Tell the students that the 12 zodiac constellations correspond to the location of the sun during each of the 12 months. When the sun is \"in\" one of them (e.g., Leo), we can't see the constellation. Only when we go into space, where sunlight is not scattered by Earth's atmosphere, can we see the stars and sun together. Even then, some of the stars near the sun are hard to see due to its bright light. We can catch glimpses of bright stars and planets during a total solar eclipse, when we can see beyond our atmosphere.\nExplain that planets and our moon move around the sun on a plane, like a huge dinner plate with the sun in the center. The zodiac constellations lie beyond this plane, appearing roughly east to west across Earth's sky. The planets, moon, and sun never appear in the sky north or south of this band of stars.\nReview the zodiac constellations and look closely at the figures these star patterns are supposed to represent. Ask students which ones most resemble the pictures. These are Leo, (lion), Scorpio (scorpion), and Taurus (bull--face and horns only).\nMake enlarged copies of some of these constellations without the lines for the students to make their own constellations. Have them use the patterns of the stars (dots) to turn them into pictures of things familiar to them.\nHave students research the legends connected with constellations. These may be found at the Web site below. Click on Star Myths to reach links to a wide variety of legends about various constellations and planets.\n\nResources: , copies of the Zodiac Constellations (see the activity page link below), \n, transparency film,"}]}

The subject of a clause may be expressed or understood. \r\nThere are two types of clauses.\r\n(a)\r\nA main clause (independent clause) contains the main thought of the sentence and makes sense standing alone.\r\nExamples:  I spoke to the teacher who is our football coach.\r\nThe dog that was barking chased me across the lawn.\r\n(b)\r\nA subordinate clause (dependent clause) cannot make sense standing on its own.  To make a sentence, a subordinate clause must be added to a main clause.\r\nExamples:  I saw the dog when I came home.\r\nThey went to the store so they could buy ice cream.\r\nSubordinate clauses add information to a sentence and function in the same way as adjectives, adverbs, or nouns.\r\nExamples:\r\nThe woman who received the prize is my mother.  (adjective)\r\nOur class stops working when the bell rings.  (adverb)\r\nI think that we should always do the right thing.  (noun)\r\nSentences are analyzed by finding and naming the clauses.\r\n(a)\r\nSimple sentences consist of one clause.\r\nExample: \r\nHorses run.\r\n(b) Complex sentences have more than one subject-verb combination and thus have more than one clause.  A complex sentence has at least one main clause and one or more subordinate clauses.  A subordinate clause is introduced by a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun.\r\nExample:  I was resting while he was swimming laps.\r\n(c)\r\nCompound sentences consist of two or more main clauses (independent clauses) joined by a conjunction.\r\nExample:  I washed the dishes, and Billy dried them.\r\nTeaching Strategies\nThe main thing \r\nProvide students with practice in finding the main clause in a sentence by having them search through a photocopy of a familiar story, circling the main clauses. Remind them that a main clause can stand alone and contains the main thought of the sentence.  Point out that a simple sentence is, in fact, one main clause.\r\nMain clause beep\r\nHave children sit in a circle.  Choose a child to say a word to start a clause.  Each child in turn then adds a word to build a main clause.  When the clause is complete, the next child says \"Beep.\"  The game can be extended to add a subordinate clause to the main clause.\r\nAct the clause \r\nOrganize children in groups of four.  Tell groups that the first child is to provide a verb, the second child is to provide a subject, the third child is to arrange the verb and subject to make a clause, and the fourth child is to act out the clause.  Ensure that all children get a turn in each role.\r\nClause match-up \r\nHave children match main clauses to subordinate clauses.  This is also an excellent reading activity.\n\n\n\n These are the brave boys   \n because he was feeling ill.   \n\n\n Bill did not come   \n where the bus stop was.   \n\n\n The bus driver didn't know   \n who rescued the drowning child.   \n\n\n\n\r\nClause call-out \r\nWrite a main clause on the chalkboard and challenge children to call out appropriate subordinate clauses.\n\n\n\n We went to the park   \n when we had eaten lunch.   \n\n\n \n where the banana tree grows.   \n\n\n \n because we wanted to play.   \n\n\n\n\r\nVerb search \r\nWrite some clauses on the chalkboard.

What's so \"complex\" about that?  For example, look at the following sentence:\nBecause he forgot his wedding anniversary for the tenth straight year, Roger spent a week sleeping on the porch.\r\nThe two ideas expressed in the sentence are:\n\nRoger forgot his wedding anniversary for the tenth straight year, and\nRoger spent a week sleeping on the porch.\n\r\nThe two ideas could be expressed as two separate sentences, but they are more effectively expressed in a complex sentence.  In a complex sentence the two ideas can be combined in a way that shows their cause-and-effect relationship.  Notice how the word because explains to the reader the cause of Roger's problems.  What follows the cause is the effect:  Roger spent a week sleeping on the porch.\r\nIn the sentence about Roger, the word because is called a subordinating conjunction.  That might sound like a puzzling term, but it is simply a type of word that will help you show the relationships between your ideas.

And you can guess from the first what the second word means. As a rule of thumb, when two adjectives are used to describe the same thing, they often have similar or related meanings.\r\nAnother kind of context clue consists of explanations provided by the author. Authors want readers to understand what they write. When they use a word that readers may not be familiar with, they often explain it. This is especially true for words that belong to a special vocabulary. A special vocabulary means any group of words that is used mainly by one group of people. Doctors, for instance, have a special vocabulary. It includes words like arteriosclerosis, hypertension, thrombosis, and so on. The average person may not know these words. They don't have to, because they're not doctors. So when authors use one of these words, they often explain it for readers in context.\r\nWatch how the term \"cardiopulmonary resuscitation\" is explained in the context of this next article:\r\nTeen Saves Life at Reunion\r\nORANGE--Chris Walker knew just what to do when his aunt, Wilma Walker, collapsed of a heart attack at the Walker family reunion Sunday. The 16-year-old immediately began cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to circulate blood and provide oxygen until heart and lung function could be restored.\r\nNotice how the term cardiopulmonary resuscitation is explained for readers. It's something you do \"to circulate blood and provide oxygen until heart and lung function can be restored.\"\r\nNew words are often explained this way in textbooks too. The authors of textbooks don't expect you to know all the words they use. Nor do they expect you to stop and look them up. So they explain many of them as they go along.\r\nTake the following passage from a biology book, for example. It introduces the word metabolism. This is a new word for most students. So the author defines it for readers in context. Watch for its meaning as you read the passage:\r\nMalaria is a dramatic disease. In a typical attack, the victim first feels a severe chill. Gooseflesh forms, and his teeth chatter violently. Several hours later the sufferer feels very hot. He probably has a terrible headache and a feeling of nausea. Still later he begins to sweat. Clearly, the person's metabolism-that is, the way the parts of his body are working together-has been greatly upset by the disease.\r\nNotice how the author defines the word metabolism for the reader. Metabolism means \"the way the parts of the body are working together.\" As an example, the author describes how the disease upsets the normal process.\r\nDistribute the activity sheets to students and have them use what they have learned about context clues to complete the activity.\nResources: , Using Synonyms and Explanations as Context Clues activity pages, \n, pencils, \n, newspaper,"}]}

The gunman wore a ski mask, a black sweatshirt, jeans, and dark glasses.  Jennifer began to cry because she was so scared.  \"Count to 10 before you turn around!\"  the gunman said, collecting the money; then he backed out the door and ran around the side of the building.  The clerk called the police.\n\r\n    Have students fill out the Crime Report (page 81) and write a one-paragraph summary of the incident with the information given.  In the paragraph, write only the necessary facts and write them in the exact order in which they happened.  Will you need to write that Jennifer cried?  No. Will you need to write that the gunman wore a mask? Yes. Discuss any problems or questions the students have.\r\n    Display the Prehospital Care Report (page 82).  Explain that this is the kind of report a paramedic must fill out for every patient.  Note that information on this form consists of medical data with a detailed description of the patient's physical condition, including injuries and data regarding the patient's allergies and medical history.  \"Chief complaint\" would be the reason a paramedic was called.  Instead of a summary such as a police officer writes, a paramedic lists events and the times when they occur.  Time is given in military time--that is, in number of hours since 12:00 midnight.  In military time two P.M. would be 14:00 hours.  On this particular report we have the following:\n\n\n\n\n 23:20   \n Arrived on scene--assessed pt. (patient)   \n\n\n 23:25   \n Extricated from car with spine precautions   \n\n\n 23:26   \n Vital signs taken (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration)   \n\n\n\n\n\nRead the Emergency Incident (page 84) to students.  They are going to write crime reports and prehospital care reports for this incident.  Divide the class into cooperative learning groups.  Distribute to each group a blank crime report (page 81), a blank Prehospital Care Report (page 83), and a copy of the Emergency Incident (page 84).  Elicit from students that this incident is a crime because the driver of the car left the scene of the accident, which is hit and run--a crime.  Instruct each group to assign one person as recorder for the group, and to choose this person carefully because the report must be very neat.  When the activity is complete, discuss the student's results.  This activity may be repeated as often as needed until students are competent report writers.\n\r\nBackground/Follow-Up\r\nIt is said that over 90 percent of police recruits who do not make it onto the force fail because they are unable to write clear and accurate reports.  The same is true for paramedics, nurses, and doctors.  Clear, accurate reports are essential for success in any of these fields.\nResources: , copies of activity pages 81, 82, 83, and 84, \n, pencils,"}]}

I'm Nice!'. Encourage daily hands-on activities and discussions.

I'm Nice!\nGrade Level: 5th - 8th Grades\nDescription: Language Arts, Writing, Writing Process\nObjective: Students practice creating resumes.\nDirections: Since many students do not yet work, one way to practice resume writing is to have students pick a career they might be interested in pursuing in the future.  With the help of the class, list several possible career choices on the board or overhead.  Next, pass out sections of the classifieds to the students.  Explain how the classifieds are organized.  Show students how to find jobs that have been listed on the board.  Next, look for jobs that no one has mentioned.\r\nAfter students have seen what types of jobs are available, you can assign careers in one of two ways:\n\nHave students look through the classifieds and decide on a job.\nHave students draw from a collection of classified advertisements that you have previously cut out and gathered.\n\r\nWhen students decide on jobs, help them determine what type of education, work experience, etc., they will need for the job.  Encourage students to be creative and make up whatever information they will need for their resume.\r\nHave students create their own resumes by studying the sample resume on page 51.  If students do not have access to a computer, you may want to allow the resumes to be handwritten.\r\nFor an optional activity, hand out only five or six different job descriptions to the entire class.  This way several students will apply for the same job.  Determine which students have the same jobs and set up a date for students to interview for the position.  The teacher can act as the employer, or another adult can be invited to the classroom to help with this activity.  Have the students interview for the jobs and compare their resumes to determine who gets \"hired\" for the position.\r\nUse the following information to instruct students about writing a resume:\r\nUnless you happen to know a friend or relative who is hiring, getting a job is not always easy.  It takes more to get a job than simply being a nice person.  Most companies will require you to show how qualified you are for the job you want.  Most will want to know your educational background and other job-related experiences that you've had.\r\nEmployers do not expect students to have extensive work experience, but they do want a resume that shows you have experience as a leader and that you would be a benefit to the company if they hired you.\r\nNot every job requires a resume.  Many jobs only require that you fill out an application.  However, it is a good idea to have an updated resume on file at all times so that when a job becomes available that does require a resume, you are ready to go.  Remember these helpful hints when writing your own resume:\n\nA resume lists a person's qualifications for a job.\nIt includes a person's name, address, and telephone number.\nIt includes a person's educational information and previous work experience.\nInformation on a resume should be listed in chronological order, listing the most recent experiences first.\n\n\r\nOn a resume, do not include your work experience if it is not relative to the job you are trying to get.  As a person gains more education, it is no longer necessary to include information such as middle school attended, etc.  However, if you are a student in high school and you are trying to get a job as a counselor at a summer camp, this type of information is relevant to your resume.\r\nA resume should always be typed, and it should be no longer than one page.  There is no one correct style for a resume, but information should be neatly arranged on the page.  Remember that you are trying to persuade someone to hire you, so be sure and emphasize any qualifications you might have that will help you get the job.  A student looking for a job may want to include on his or her resume  items such as community service or future goals.\r\nSome companies may ask for a written reference from your friends, family, or past employers.  A written reference is a letter from someone that recommends you as a good employee or worker.  Others may ask for a list of names and phone numbers of your references so that the employer can call and speak personally to the references you have given.\nResources: , Sample Resume, \n,  Computers, \n,  Classified Ads,"}]}

It is always a good idea for speakers to learn famous or well-known quotations, since these make great introductions.  It is also possible to present a simple incident in a dramatic or storytelling format.\r\nExample:  A young child rummages through the garbage behind a grocery store.  She pulls her thin jacket around her frail body and shivers against the cold.

After all, the essay is the basic of most academic writing.  But we also know that teaching essay writing is not easy.  An introduction and conclusion are vital elements of a good essay.\r\nThe introduction of an essay serves two purposes: it clarifies what the essay is about, and it grabs the readers interest.  The first goal is straightforward.  The second is more challenging.\r\nAsk students to think about some of their favorite movies.  Ask them to think about how the movies begin.  They will probably discover that most movies begin with a dramatic or suspenseful opening.  This is called a hook.  Whether it is a bit of slapstick humor or a violent encounter, the hook is intended to get you involved with the story right away and keep you watching.  The same principle applies to essay writing.\r\nTell students that this does not mean that they must begin their essays with a sensational opening.  However, they should interest the reader by showing, not telling.  Read the following two sentences to them:\r\n\"Kids eat a lot of food that is really bad for them.\"\r\n\"The sugar-coated purple cereal is disappearing as you slurp it down with chocolate milk.\"\r\nThe first sentence does a good job of clarifying the topic.  But which did students prefer?  The second version is more lively, beginning with a story line and grabbing the interest of the reader.  The words are lively and we are shown someone eating instead of being told about it.\r\nThe first sentence does not have to be quite so dramatic to catch the interest of the reader.  A sentence that gets the reader involved can also work.  For example-\"What do you think of when you hear the words health food?\"\r\nThe primary purpose of the conclusion is to bring the paper to an end, to wrap it up.  Like introductions, good conclusions are interesting, leaving the reader with a strong sense of the paper.  You should mention the points that you just covered, but you don't need to spell them out.  This can be done in a number of ways.  Read the following two conclusion sentences to students:\r\n\"In conclusion, eating healthful foods makes a lot of sense.\"\r\n\"So, the next time you pop that jaw breaker into your mouth, the next time you eat oily potato chips for dinner, remember that there are tasty choices that won't hurt your body.\"\r\nThe first sentence is OK.  It uses the helpful phrase in conclusion and reminds the reader what he or she just read.  But ask students again which sentence they preferred.  The second example is livelier and brings the essay to a close while keeping the reader involved.  It also has the same kinds of story line as the second introduction.  This is called an envelope strategy, which is common in essay and story writing.  You open and close your essay in the same way.  This helps to give your essay a sense of order.\r\nDistribute copies of the Introductions and Conclusions activity sheet to students and have them try writing some interesting and lively introductions and conclusions.\nResources: , Introductions and Conclusions activity sheet (one per student), \n, pencils or pens,"}]}

Before you begin, have students bring in newspapers from home.  If students are unable to bring in newspapers, you can contact your local newspaper.  Many publishers have specific programs for schools where copies of newspapers can be purchased at a reduced rate.  Find an empty counter space and stack them in specific sections.

Allow students to use maps or other reference materials as needed.\r\nYou will have to judge whether or not students find appropriate responses.  Have students justify their answers if there are doubts.  For example, if the list item says \"Something that you eat for lunch,\" and a group of students glues the word \"egg\" on their answer sheet, you might respond by telling them that an egg is a breakfast food.

Something is shared between two people or things.\r\nExamples:  \r\nI divided the cake among the whole class.\r\nI divided the cake between Mary and me.\nin/into-In shows position in one place.

Never say different than.\nbeside/besides-Beside means at the side of.  Besides means in addition to.\r\nExamples:  \r\nThe teacher stood beside the table.\r\nSeveral girls were there besides Margaret.\n\nPreposition or adverb? \r\nSome prepositions may look like adverbs.  To tell whether the word is a preposition or an adverb, look at the way it is used.  Look at the following sentences.\r\nI fell down.  Down is an adverb of place.  It tells where I fell.\r\nI walked down the road.  Down is a preposition governing road.\r\nRemember also that a preposition has a noun or pronoun after it.\nTeaching Strategies \nQuestion time \r\nAsk children to describe the positions of some objects in the classroom.  Tell children they must reply using a preposition in a sentence.\r\nWhere is the clock?\r\nThe clock is under the picture.\r\nWhere is the television?\r\nThe television is beside the table.\nPreposition opposites \r\nHave children provide the opposites of given prepositions.\r\nThe snake crawled over the rock.\r\nThe snake crawled under the rock.\nJumbled prepositions\r\nGive children exercises in which the prepositions are jumbled.

Stories have been passed down as family treasures to be taken out, enjoyed, wrapped in memories, and carefully tucked away to be cherished by yet another generation.  The stories of how our families came to settle where they did; how they survived hard times; how our parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles met and married have become the keynote speeches of the family dinners.\r\nThe ability to relate a story well is a skill that will enrich everyone's lives and create emotional ties between new generations of our families and friends.  These are the stories most requested by separated or adopted children.  The stories provide us with a sense of belonging and a secure place in the world.\n\r\nStories are priceless gifts that should not be lost with the passing of our family members but should be filed away to be discovered and treasured by future generations.  The struggles our families faced to settle a new world and our victories over those struggles provide our strength to overcome future struggles that we--or our children--might face.\n\r\nWe are all survivors of the perils of the ages and have in our families stories of the Civil War, westward expansion, persecution, and the fabric that makes up the history of mankind.  Develop and preserve these stories and the ability to relate them.\n\r\nThe activity that follows provides the format and opportunity to develop these storytelling skills.  The stories may be organized by use of an organizer called the storyboard.  The stories need not be written out but rather organized in topical format, or outline, and related to the group.\n\nStorytelling:  Chill Out\n\nNo storytelling unit would be complete without the tale of terror.  The \"gotcha'\" stories are in this category also.  A gotcha' story is one that sounds frightening and is filled with suspense.  At the end the storyteller yells out and grabs someone close saying \"Gotcha'!\"  These stories are often related in the dark, at camp outs, and at slumber parties.  No doubt you have already heard many.\r\nThis is a story type that allows the storyteller to set the mood.  The speaker may build suspense by using facial expressions or vocal inflections.  A good storyteller can scare the daylights out of his or her listeners!  The success of recent horror movies shows us that many of us love to be scared.  Perhaps it is a way of confronting our fears and making us see how silly they really are.  There are classic tales of terror that have been told for generations.\n\nAssignment:  Prepare and tell a tale of terror you have heard, or create an original.  Use the storyboard organizer on page 100 to prepare your story and share it with the class.  The following is a list of classic tales of terror that circulate today.  These might help you select your own tale of terror.\n\nThe Man with the Hook Arm\nThe Hitchhiker\nA babysitter gets a call from a murderer who claims he is calling from inside the house.\nA girl is followed home by a man who keeps turning on his bright lights, only to discover he is trying to protect her from the person hiding in her back seat.\nThe girl at the slumber party  who goes to the grave to  plunge in a letter opener  to prove to others she is  not afraid.  She  unknowingly plunges it  into the hem of her  nightgown.  It pins her to  the grave; and thinking  she is being grabbed  by the living dead, she  dies of fright. \n\r\nThese are common stories, but you may have better tales of terror to tell!\nResources: , Storytelling activity sheet, \n, pencils,"}]}

An antecedent is the word to which a pronoun refers.\r\nBetty brought her book to class.\r\nIn this sentence, her is the only pronoun.  Its antecedent is Betty because Betty is the word to which the pronoun refers.  When we talk about pronoun-antecedent agreement, we mean that pronouns must agree in number and gender with their antecedents.  If Betty is the antecedent, we couldn't say, \"Betty brought his book,\" or \"Betty brought their book.\"  In those sentences, the pronouns don't agree with their antecedents.\r\nThe only time this gets tricky is when we use the indefinite pronouns.  These are indefinite pronouns:\r\none, everyone, someone, no one, anyone, everybody, nobody, anybody, somebody, each, either, neither, several, few, both, many, all, most, any, none.\r\nHere are the rules about using indefinite pronouns properly so that the pronoun and antecedent agree:\n\nThese indefinite pronouns are singular and therefore take a singular antecedent: one, everyone, someone, no one, anyone, everybody, nobody, anybody, somebody, each, either, neither.\n\r\nIt's easy to remember most of these because most of them end in either one or body, and we know that one and body are singular.\r\nEverybody has his or her book.\r\nNote: In the above sentence, many people would use the word their in place of his or her.  This is incorrect because everybody is a singular pronoun which is not gender specific.  Many people prefer to use the male pronoun his when referring to all of us.  This is still considered acceptable grammar.  Nowadays, however, we generally say his or her so that we have a singular pronoun and are not being gender-biased.\n\nThese indefinite pronouns are plural and therefore take plural antecedents: several, few, both, many.\n\r\n(Write the following sentences on the board and have students identify the antecedents)\r\nSeveral students lost their books.\r\nMany of us have taken our tests.\n\nThese indefinite pronouns may be either singular or plural, depending on how they are used in a sentence: all, most, any, none.\n\r\n(Write the following on the board and have students identify whether the pronouns should be singular or plural.)\r\nMost of the apples are rotten. (plural)\r\nMost of the milk is gone. (singular)\r\nNote: If a sentence has a compound antecedent (more than one) joined by or or nor, the pronoun agrees with the antecedent closer to it.\r\nEither the girls or Jose brought his car.\r\nEither Jose or the girls brought their car.\r\nDistribute the activity sheets and have students practice the rules that they have learned.\nResources: , Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement Practice Activity Sheet, \n, pencils,"}]}

What's the best way to teach such an important skill?  To teach this lesson it may simply be better to show than to tell.\nDirections: Pass out copies of the worksheet on page 74; read the material on this page to the class.  Pass out copies of the worksheet on page 75.  Follow the directions given for Section A of Part 2 on page 75.  When everyone has finished writing instructions for how to put on a jacket, ask for a volunteer to read his or her paper out loud.  As the student reads his instructions, try to put on the jacket.  The task will be nearly impossible because most students do not even begin with the most basic instruction:  pick up the jacket.  It is hard to put on something that is not in your hands.  After two or three students have read their instructions, discuss what changes are needed for the instructions to be correct.\n\r\nNow tell the students to work on Section B of the worksheet and to write instructions, for sharpening a pencil.  When everyone has finished, ask for a volunteer to go to the pencil sharpener.  Next, have someone read his or her instructions.  Instructions this time should be more accurate as students should begin to understand the importance of detail when writing directions.  Be sure and point out that following and listening to instructions is as important as giving good instructions.  Even a good explanation will not work if the other person doesn't pay attention to the details.\nResources: , bring a jacket or coat to class., \n, copies of the activity sheets on pages 74 and 75 (see link to these pages below),"}]}

They use her technique of firsthand knowledge about a subject to write newspaper articles.\nDirections: This activity can be completed as part of a Women's History Month unit, or as a standalone activity.\r\nBegin the activity by introducing students to Nelly Bly, who was a woman reporter long before it was common to find women in the field.\r\nWhat twenty-year-old woman in 1887 would dare have herself committed to a mental institution in order to write an article about the treatment of the mentally ill?  Having achieved success with this technique once, what woman would dare to try it again to find out about prison life, sweat shops, and slums?  The only correct answer to both questions is Elizabeth Cochran Seaman, better known as Nelly Bly!\r\nElizabeth received her first job when she wrote a response to an article that appeared in the Pittsburgh Dispatch.  The article had been titled \"What Girls Are Good For.\"  Elizabeth's letter convinced many people, including the editor of the Dispatch, that women were good for writing.\r\nAmerica became aware of the woman reporter through the work of \"Nelly Bly,\" Elizabeth's pen name taken from a song by Stephen Foster.  For her stories, she went down in a diving bell and up in a balloon; she posed as a Salvation Army worker, a ballet dancer, and a criminal; she even spent the night in a house that was supposed to be haunted.\r\nBut her greatest feat was a trip around the world in only 72 days, 6 hours, and 11 minutes; she had broken the record of a character in Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days.  By using trains, boats, and horses, she had made the trip of a lifetime and had even found time to stop in France and interview Verne himself.  The headline on the day of the twenty-three-old woman's return to New York was \"Father Time Outdone.\"  Elizabeth often laughed and told about her uncle who had also traveled around the world--in a period of three years.\r\nWhen Elizabeth was thirty, she married millionaire Robert Seaman who was eighty years old.  Elizabeth retired from her work as a reporter.  When Seaman died in 1904, she attempted to run his business, but lawsuits with employees cost her the fortune.  Elizabeth returned to newspaper writing.\r\nAt a time in history when many women were restricted to housework and family, Elizabeth was a pace-setter with her travels, her adventures, and her writing.  Until her death by pneumonia in 1922 at age 55, she was employed at the New York Journal and doing what she liked best--writing!\r\nSuggested Activities\n\nDiscussion Questions\r\n    \nKnowledge: What was Nelly Bly's married name?\nComprehension: Why was a trip around the world so unusual in Nelly's time?\nCreative Thinking: Plan a news story that Nelly might wish to cover in your community.  Remember that she covered haunted houses, hospital visits, and tried various occupations.\nApplication: Write a news story about something that is going on in your school.  Be sure to give it a \"catchy\" title.\nAnalysis: List some of the news stories that Nelly Bly wrote.\nSynthesis: Plan a trip around the world for Nelly today.  Try to use as many means of transportation as possible.  Do not forget you can include camels and donkeys as well as rockets and planes.  (Be sure to use the animals in their appropriate settings.)  To help you, use a chart with these headings: From (Place), To (Place), Method of Transportation.\nEvaluation: Which of the modes of transportation you listed above is the most unusual?  Which do you think Nelly would enjoy most?  Why?\nAffective: Nelly made a difference by writing about the treatment of the mentally ill people.  Is there a group of people in society today that is not getting a \"fair shake\" in your opinion?  Is there anything you can do to make a difference in their lives?\n\n\nSkills Focus\r\n    \nLanguage and Communication Skills: Pretend you are Nelly Bly and that you have just completed the trip around the world as planned in the activity above.  Have a friend interview you and ask you questions about that trip.\nIndependent Study Skills: Is there an award given to good news stories?  Use your library to find out about this award(s).\nManipulative Skills: Using a large sheet of construction paper, display the news stories each class member has written.  Post the \"newspaper\" somewhere in your school for others to see.\n\n\nSocial Science\r\n    \nJob Description:  When you accompany your parents to the grocery store or when you visit the school cafeteria, observe the workers.  Watch what they do.  Watch what others say to them.  When you get a chance, write a description of one of the jobs.  What are the good points of that job?  Are there bad points?  Describe this occupation as Nelly Bly might have written about it.\n\n\n\n\r\nDistribute the Newspaper Article activity sheet to students.  Have them use what they have learned about Nelly Bly to complete the activity.\nResources: , Newspaper Article activity sheet, \n, pencils, \n, drawing materials,"}]}
